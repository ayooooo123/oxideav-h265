# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the crate adheres
to [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Inter prediction-block availability now reads the existing reconstruction
  mode grid instead of allocating and scanning the full motion field for
  every inter CU. Completed inter CUs stamp that grid; intra stamps, WPP
  halos, tile bands, slice/z-order gates and the current-CU inter override
  are preserved. No extra picture-sized storage or decoder API change.
- Single-thread decoding of inter-heavy 1080p streams takes about 4×
  fewer CPU cycles with unchanged output (120-frame 1080p Main / Main10
  clips on an M1 Pro: 30.5G → ~7.0G and 34.0G → ~7.8G cycles). Inter
  prediction is written straight into the picture and each coding unit's
  residual is added per transform block; picture, motion-field and
  output-plane buffers are recycled; interpolation, the inverse transform
  (vectorizable flat scaling over the non-zero extent, a four-column
  column pass), residual significance contexts, SAO, deblocking edge
  derivation, CABAC bit reads and 10-bit output packing were
  restructured. Every output plane of the 188 FATE conformance streams,
  serial and two-thread, is byte-identical to the previous decoder,
  including the errors reported on malformed streams. The internal
  `recon::extract_cu_residual` / `CuResidual` / `CuResidualPlane` are
  gone.
- The inverse transform uses the recursive partial butterfly (about a
  third fewer multiply-accumulates, the same integer sums) and scales
  whole coefficient rows so short rows vectorize; 10-bit output planes are
  packed without zero-filling first; the luma deblocking decisions are
  evaluated without data-dependent branches.
- On aarch64 (phones and Apple silicon), NEON kernels run luma / chroma
  interpolation, SAO edge / band offset spans, the default weighted
  prediction combine and the luma deblocking filters (`src/simd/`). Each
  mirrors a portable kernel, which stays the reference and runs on every
  other target and when `simd::set_enabled(false)` is set. The crate now
  denies `unsafe` code everywhere except that one module, where every
  pointer access is bounds-checked first. Output is bit-identical either
  way.

### Added

- Complete-picture motion-neighbour regression for all eight partition
  shapes, plus complete FFmpeg output checks for twelve Main/Main10,
  mixed intra/inter, merge/AMVP, tile, slice and WPP fixtures in serial
  and two-thread decoding. Each fixture also exercises 128 deterministic
  VCL mutations followed by recreation and exact full-output recovery.
- `tests/simd_differential.rs`: on aarch64, the NEON and portable kernels
  decode every embedded and `tests/fixture_bytes` stream, every original
  FATE HEVC conformance stream (serial and two-thread) and the 1,536-case
  VCL mutation corpus, and must agree on every frame and reported error.
  The module's unit tests compare randomized interpolation blocks, SAO
  pictures, prediction units and luma deblocking segments.
- Strict original-FATE coverage (`tests/fate_conformance.rs`, `FATE_SUITE`):
  52 complete Main/Main10/RExt streams against FFmpeg, serial and two-thread.
  The availability change preserves all four pre-existing mismatches:
  two-thread `TILES_A_Cisco_2`, `TILES_B_Cisco_1`, `DSLICE_C_HHI_5`, and
  serial `SLICES_A_Rovi_3`. Every affected output-frame hash is identical
  to the upstream baseline. These assertions remain failing, not pinned
  to incorrect pixels. FFmpeg also rejects the unequal luma/chroma depth
  in `TSUNEQBD_A_MAIN10_Technicolor_2`; that oracle limit remains explicit.
  The other 47 originals (1,951 frames per thread budget), including all
  ten staged RExt cases, match completely.

### Fixed

- A P or B picture whose reference was decoded under a replaced SPS of
  another bit depth or chroma format is now a decode error. Before, the
  reference's samples were read at the current bit depth: in an 8-bit
  picture, 10-bit samples overflowed the 16-bit interpolation sums (a panic
  with overflow checks, wrapped samples without), with either kernel set.
- `log2_sao_offset_scale_luma` / `_chroma` above `Max( 0, BitDepth − 10 )`
  of the active SPS are now a decode error, as FFmpeg rejects them. Before,
  a scale of 31 made an offset of 1 `i32::MIN`: with overflow checks the
  16-bit SAO lane test panicked, and without them the offset entered those
  lanes and was truncated to 0. That lane test is now a range test, so a
  directly supplied offset outside `−1023..=1023` takes the 32-bit path.
- `tests/hostile_parameter_sets.rs` decodes both cases end to end (an
  8-bit SPS, PPS and P slice after a 10-bit IDR; PPS scales of 1 and 31 on
  an 8-bit stream) with both kernel sets and requires an error; a re-sent
  unchanged SPS and in-range scales still decode exactly.

## [0.0.14](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-h265/compare/v0.0.13...v0.0.14) - 2026-10-01

### Added

- *(decoder)* tile-parallel decoding under the ExecutionContext budget — 4x4-tiled 12 MP still 0.23 s -> 0.064 s on 8 workers
- *(decoder)* wavefront decode of WPP pictures and row-parallel in-loop filters under the ExecutionContext budget — 12 MP still 0.24 s -> 0.063 s on 8 workers

### Other

- *(readme)* round-464 decoder profile after the per-min-block availability change
- *(decoder)* per-min-block intra reference availability, zero-level scaling skip, in-place bdShift round
- *(decoder)* even/odd inverse transform over the non-zero coefficient extent — 12 MP still 0.46 s -> 0.25 s
- *(decoder)* lean decode memory for HEIF stills — u16 copy-on-write planes, CTU-streamed reconstruction, in-place SAO, edge-map deblocking, DPB eviction

### Added

- *(decoder)* **parallel decoding of a single picture under the core thread budget** (`SequenceDecoder::set_threads`; the registry decoder's `set_execution_context` — serial until told otherwise, bit-identical for any budget): a picture coded with `entropy_coding_sync_enabled_flag` and no tiles decodes its CTB rows in a **wavefront** — the CTB at column `c` of row `r` starts once row `r − 1` finished column `c + 1` — each row parsed *and* reconstructed by one worker into its own band structures (a `Picture` / motion field / intra-mode field / parse state band of the CTB row plus a four-line halo; `Picture::new_band`, `row` / `row_mut`, `MotionField::new_band`, …), the §9.3.2.4 context storage, bottom sample lines, bottom cell rows, slice identity and SAO parameters of every CTB published to the row below, the finished rows copied into disjoint row chunks of the whole-picture structures (`sequence::wavefront`); multi-slice / dependent-segment WPP pictures follow the §9.3.2.5 synchronization rules per row part. For every picture under a budget the §8.7 filters run **row-parallel** (`inter_recon::filter_picture`: vertical edges by CTB row, horizontal edges by CTB row with the chunk split four rows early, SAO by CTB row from a band whose halo lines were saved after deblocking). Gated off for tiles, SCC palette / current-picture referencing, chroma QP offset lists, multi-layer and the tolerant debug mode (those fall back to serial parse + parallel filters, or serial). Measured on the M4 Max (registry path, best of 5): the 12 MP 8-bit WPP still 0.239 s serial → 0.143 / 0.086 / **0.063 s** at 2 / 4 / 8 workers (RSS 77 → 80 / 84 / 103 MiB), a third-party encoder's 12 MP WPP still 0.50 → 0.105 s, the 10-bit WPP still 0.255 → 0.083 s, the 48-tile Apple grid (WPP tiles, decoded one after the other) 0.46 → 0.17 s at 4, a plain still without WPP or tiles 0.223 → 0.208 s (filters only — never slower). `tests/threaded_decode.rs` pins every embedded fixture, the 25 real-world stills and the official `WPP_HIGH_TP` stream byte-identical at budgets 1 / 2 / 3 / 5, the registry pins under a budget, and a budgeted still decode never slower than serial (ratio bound)
- *(decoder)* **tile-parallel decoding**: a tiled picture without `entropy_coding_sync` decodes its tiles on the workers (`sequence::wavefront::TilePlan` / `decode_tiles`) — each tile parsed and reconstructed into a rectangular band (`Picture::new_rect_band`, `MotionField::new_rect_band`, the intra-mode / parse / QP / edge maps likewise; fresh contexts at every tile start, no neighbour outside the tile available), merged into the whole-picture structures, the CUs on a tile's left / top boundary re-deriving their §8.7.2.4 strengths over the merged motion field (their p side lies in another tile), then the row-parallel filters. The 12 MP 8-bit still coded as a 4x4 tile grid: 0.231 s serial → 0.137 / 0.085 / 0.064 s at 2 / 4 / 8 workers, bytes identical; WPP-inside-tiles pictures stay serial
- *(decoder)* at `flush` the registry decoder releases every reference picture (`SequenceDecoder::release_references`) so the frames it then drains own their planes and pack without a copy — a third-party still whose SPS allows a multi-picture DPB now peaks at 84 MiB instead of 106

### Changed

- *(decoder)* **decode memory for production HEIF stills** — a 12 MP 8-bit 4:2:0 still decodes through the registry at **67 MiB peak RSS (was 326 MiB)**, the 10-bit one at 71 MiB (was 321), bytes identical on every conformance / real-world pin: (1) `Picture` stores samples as `u16` (every §A bit depth fits; the accessors still widen to `i32`) behind shared copy-on-write planes — cloning a picture shares its buffers, so the DPB reference and the output `DecodedFrame` of one picture are one allocation; `Picture::from_planes` / `into_planes` (the ownership hand-off: a uniquely held plane moves out without a copy) and `is_shared` are additive; `plane` / `plane_mut`, `deblock::SamplePlane` and `inter_pred::RefPlane` carry `u16`; (2) the picture is reconstructed **CTU by CTU as the CABAC walk produces it** (`inter_recon::PictureReconstructor::push_ctu` / `finish`; `reconstruct_inter_picture` wraps it) — a picture's syntax tree, with every transform block's coefficient levels, never exists whole; (3) §8.7.3 SAO runs **in place** from a (CTB height + 2)-line band copy per plane (`sao::apply_sao_picture_in_place`; the two-picture `apply_sao_picture_full` now clones once and delegates) instead of two whole-picture copies; (4) §8.7.2 deblocking derives each CU's edge flags and `bS` into a picture-wide edge map as the CTU lands (`deblock::DeblockEdgeMap`, `deblock_picture_edges` / `deblock_rows_edges` — a vertical-pass row band and a horizontal-pass row band touch disjoint samples) instead of keeping every CU's descriptor + transform split until the end; (5) the motion field keeps one mode byte per 4x4 cell and allocates the reference / vector payload (16-bit vectors, as eqs 8-94 .. 8-101 bound them) on the first inter cell — an intra picture carries 0.8 MB instead of 21 MB at 12 MP; (6) the DPB **evicts** pictures marked "unused for reference" at the next picture (§C.5.2.2; it previously grew without bound over a sequence) and a picture decoded under `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1 == 0` (every still) is never stored — the output frame holds the only copy, which the registry packs plane by plane, freeing each `u16` plane as its 8-bit / little-endian-16 twin is built. Decode wall time 0.49 s → 0.46 s for the 12 MP 8-bit still (block writers take the plane once instead of a per-sample accessor; the SAO classification tests the picture / slice / tile boundary only on a CTB's border samples)
- *(decoder)* **inverse transform as the even / odd regrouping of the §8.6.4.2 matrix product** (`transform::inverse_transform`): each `n`-point synthesis pairs outputs `(i, n − 1 − i)` around the even-coefficient `n / 2`-point synthesis and the odd-coefficient partial sum — the basis symmetry `transMatrix[ n − 1 − i ][ j ] = (−1)^j · transMatrix[ i ][ j ]` only re-associates integer additions, so every result is the matrix product bit for bit (pinned on every basis vector of every block size, `i32` and `i64` accumulators) — and both passes run over the block's non-zero extent only (the §7.3.8.11 scan leaves everything past the last significant position zero; an all-zero block is a no-op); `i32` arithmetic unless `extended_precision_processing_flag`. The 12 MP 8-bit still decodes in **0.25 s (was 0.46 s)**, the 10-bit one 0.26 s (was 0.47), the 48-tile Apple grid 0.48 s (was 0.68), bytes identical
- *(decoder)* serial reconstruction trims (bit-identical): the §8.4.4.2 reference-sample gathering tests the §6.4.1 availability once per 4x4 luma min block instead of per sample (it is a property of the neighbour's min block — a 12 MP still 0.239 → 0.221 s), §8.6.3 scaling skips zero levels (they scale to zero), the §8.6.2 `bdShift` round runs in place over the transform output, and the block writers take a plane once per block
- *(examples)* `decode_bench`: the registry decode path (`make_decoder`) over one or more Annex B streams with `threads=N` / `repeat=N`, reporting the best wall time and an FNV-1a digest of the output planes

## [0.0.13](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-h265/compare/v0.0.12...v0.0.13) - 2026-09-27

### Added

- *(encoder)* WPP-parallel pass 1 — wavefront-scheduled CTB rows on the ExecutionContext workers
- *(encoder)* cqpoffset — PPS chroma QP offsets on the quadtree intra coder
- *(encoder)* lossy intra coding in every HEIC sample layout — 4:2:0 10/12, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 at 8/10/12, grey 8/10/12

### Fixed

- *(registry)* read image_planes() — side-channel records are not picture planes; ColorSignal defaults the VUI range

### Other

- *(encoder)* u16 sample path and a sample format through the quadtree coder

### Added

- *(encoder)* **WPP-parallel pass 1**: a single-tile `wpp` picture decides its CTB rows in a wavefront on up to the `ExecutionContext` worker count (`set_execution_context` / `SpsCfg::threads`) — the CTB at column `c` starts once the row above finished column `c + 1`, each worker deciding into its own state after pulling that above-row neighbourhood from the shared picture state and publishing each finished CTB back; the RDOQ shadow coder of a row starts from the row above's §9.3.2.2 storage, so the bytes equal the serial pass for any worker count (pinned for a P / B GOP and a 4:4:4 10-bit intra still). CTU-level rate feedback (a serial running-size dependency) and tiled pictures keep their previous fan-out — the 12 MP 8-bit still at level 2: 42.1 s serial → 7.5 s on 8 workers (bytes identical; 13.3 s on 4), the 10-bit one 8.1 s
- *(registry)* the encoder reads a frame's `image_planes()` — core's colour-signal / palette / significant-bits / layer side-channel records are no longer counted as picture planes (the HEIF demuxer attaches a colour-signal record to every frame; a `Yuv420P` frame with one encodes byte-identically to the same frame without it, on every mode); absent an explicit `range` option the stream's `CodecParameters::color_signal` range — and on the per-picture-SPS `pcm` / `intra` modes a per-frame record's — defaults the VUI `video_full_range_flag`, and their H.273 code points the colour description when no `colorprim` / `transfer` / `matrix` option is given
- *(encoder)* `cqpoffset` (−12..=12; quadtree intra coder): `pps_cb_qp_offset == pps_cr_qp_offset`, applied by the §8.6.1 chroma QP derivation (Table 8-10 at 4:2:0, `Min( qPi, 51 )` otherwise) and the §8.7.2.5 chroma deblocking `cQpPicOffset`; `SpsCfg::chroma_qp_offset` on the direct path. Measured on the 4:4:4 10-bit 12 MP still against a third-party encoder at the same QPs: luma-only BD-rate +4.9 % at 0, +2.7 % at +3, +0.7 % at +6 — while the 6:1:1-weighted YUV BD-rate is −7.1 % / −6.3 % / −4.6 % (this coder spends its extra 4:4:4 bytes on chroma, the third-party one barely more than at 4:2:0), so the default stays 0
- *(encoder)* **lossy intra coding in every HEIC sample layout**: the registry `mode = "intra"` accepts `Yuv420P10Le` / `Yuv420P12Le`, `Yuv422P` / `YuvJ422P` / `Yuv422P10Le` / `Yuv422P12Le`, `Yuv444P` / `YuvJ444P` / `Yuv444P10Le` / `Yuv444P12Le`, `Gray8` / `Gray10Le` / `Gray12Le` and codes them through the quadtree coder (`ctb` defaults to 64; every quadtree tool, loop filter, AQ, rate-control, HRD and VUI option applies; `qp` reaches `−QpBdOffsetY`), 16-bit grey staying PCM-only; the SPS signals the chroma format and bit depths and the PTL (VPS and SPS) the layout's Annex A row — Main 10 / Main 10 Still Picture or `general_profile_idc == 4` with the Table A.2 flags and, under `still`, the intra + one-picture-only flags. All 11 layouts decode byte-exact through a black-box reference decoder at odd sizes, CTB 16 / 32 / 64, with deblocking + SAO, RDOQ + sign hiding, scaling lists, AQ, tiles and WPP (`tests/still_encoder.rs` pins 11 of them); unit tests hold the decoder's reconstruction equal to the encoder's for every format with and without the tools. The 4:4:4 64x64 CU's chroma-mode election scores its chroma as 32x32 blocks. `examples/encode_still` takes a `pf=` input layout

### Changed

- *(encoder)* the quadtree coder's sample path is `u16` at every depth and carries the picture's `SampleFmt` (chroma format + luma / chroma bit depths): source and reconstruction planes, rollback snapshots, tile merges; the §8.4.4.2 prediction parameters (component bit depth, the 4:4:4 chroma filtering gate), the forward DCT / DST normalization (`log2 + BitDepth − 9`), the quantizer's `qBits` and RDOQ's coefficient-domain λ lift (`2^(2·(15 − BitDepth − log2))`), the `Qp′Y` / `Qp′C` of §8.6.1 (`QpBdOffset`, Table 8-10 at 4:2:0 and `Min( qPi, 51 )` otherwise), a `Qp′`-based mode-decision λ (identity at 8 bits), the reconstruction clip, the deblocking descriptors' bit depths / `ChromaArrayType`, the SAO estimation (`sao_offset_abs` cMax `( 1 << ( Min( bitDepth, 10 ) − 5 ) ) − 1`, `bandShift = bitDepth − 5`, no chroma for monochrome) and the SPS / VPS PTL + `chroma_format_idc` / `bit_depth_*_minus8` all follow it; the transform-tree model and emitter carry the 4:2:2 stacked chroma blocks (per-block `cbf_cb` / `cbf_cr`, Table 8-3 chroma modes), the 4:4:4 in-place 4x4 chroma and per-PB `intra_chroma_pred_mode` of `PART_NxN`, and the monochrome no-chroma tree. The 8-bit 4:2:0 paths widen on entry and narrow on output: every encoder pin stays byte-identical and a 12 MP still codes in the same CPU time (user time 51.6 s → 50.6 s at `rd=2`, within noise)

## [0.0.12](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-h265/compare/v0.0.11...v0.0.12) - 2026-09-25

### Added

- *(encoder)* lossless PCM stills in every HEIC sample layout — grey 8..16, 4:2:0 10/12, 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 at 8/10/12 bits
- *(decoder)* Annex F/G/H multi-layer decoding — MV-HEVC both views byte-exact, SHVC resampling, lhvC extradata and layer/view/ols selection
- *(annex-f)* multilayer SPS / PPS / slice header syntax — inferred rep formats, pps_multilayer_extension, inter-layer prediction and poc_reset fields
- *(vps)* Annex F vps_extension( ) — layer model, rep formats, dpb_size, VPS VUI

### Other

- *(annex-f)* layered parameter-set and slice-header parsing in parse_annexb; round-462 status
- *(shvc)* self-built two-layer spatial-scalability stream pins the Annex H path

### Added

- *(encoder)* **every HEIC sample layout as a lossless PCM still**: `PcmLayout` (`chroma_format_idc` 0..=3, bit depth 8..=16) on `PcmAuOptions` and the `encode_idr_pcm_au_wide` entry (`u16` planes); the registry `mode = "pcm"` accepts `Gray8` / `Gray10Le` / `Gray12Le` / `Gray16Le`, `Yuv420P10Le` / `Yuv420P12Le`, `Yuv422P` / `YuvJ422P` / `Yuv422P10Le` / `Yuv422P12Le`, `Yuv444P` / `YuvJ444P` / `Yuv444P10Le` / `Yuv444P12Le` (little-endian 16-bit planes above 8 bits, one plane for grey; the `YuvJ*` twins signal full range) with the conformance window in the layout's chroma units and the input format echoed; Annex A signalling per layout — Main / Main Still Picture, Main 10 / Main 10 Still Picture (`general_one_picture_only_constraint_flag`), or `general_profile_idc == 4` with the Table A.2 row's constraint flags (Monochrome / Monochrome 10 / 12 / 16, Main 12, Main 4:2:2 10 / 12, Main 4:4:4 / 10 / 12, plus the intra + one-picture-only flags of the Still Picture rows); the 8-bit 4:2:0 `u8` entry points stay byte-identical (they widen into the same writer). The intra / inter coders remain 8-bit 4:2:0 and refuse the other formats explicitly

- *(decoder)* **Annex F / Annex G multi-layer decoding** — MV-HEVC streams decode with every layer of the target output layer set: the `SequenceDecoder` keeps the VPS layer model, tracks access units (F.7.4.2.4.4: a first slice whose `nuh_layer_id` does not exceed the highest one already decoded starts the next AU), runs the F.8.1.3 per-layer `NoRaslOutputFlag` / `LayerInitializedFlag` / `FirstPicInLayerDecodedFlag` bookkeeping, the F.8.3.1 POC form (per-layer `PrevPicOrderCnt`, eq. F-62, `poc_reset_idc` 1..3 with the DPB decrement and `poc_msb_cycle_val`), the G.8.1.3 / H.8.1.3 inter-layer reference picture sets (the same-AU reference layer picture, `ViewId`-ordered into `RefPicSetInterLayer0/1`, marked "used for long-term reference" for the picture and restored per F.8.1.6) spliced into `RefPicListTemp0/1` per eqs F-65 / F-67, the F.7.4.3.2.1 representation-format override for dependent layers, F.8.3.2's cross-layer unmarking at a base-layer IRAP with `NoClrasOutputFlag`, and output gating by the OLS's output layers; `DecodedFrame` gains `layer_id` / `view_id` / `au_index`, output order is `(cvs, POC, layer)`; `LayerTarget` (`HighestOls` default, `Ols(i)`, `Layer(id)` = the layer plus its reference layers, `View(id)`) drops the other layers per F.10.1 — **both views of a three-access-unit stereo stream from an OS media framework's MV-HEVC encoder decode byte-exact against a black-box reference decoder** (`tests/multilayer.rs`, 90 KB vendored)
- *(decoder)* the §8.5.3.2.9 collocated-reference long-term gate now recognises a same-access-unit reference of the collocated picture (an inter-layer reference picture, or the SCC current picture) as long-term; `ref_pic_lists_modification( )` (`list_entry_l0/l1`) is now applied by the sequence driver (it was parsed but never reached the §8.3.4 list construction — the second view's B pictures put the inter-view picture first through it)
- *(decoder)* **Annex H SHVC**: the H.8.1.4 inter-layer reference derivation (`ilref`): H.8.1.4.1 region / scale-factor / phase geometry (with the F.7.4.3.3.4 inference of an absent vertical chroma phase), the H.8.1.4.2 16-phase 8-tap luma / 4-tap chroma resampling (Tables H.1 / H.2, separable exactly as eqs H-38 / H-39 and H-50 / H-51 compose) including bit-depth-only and chroma-format changes, and the H.8.1.4.3 motion / mode resampling with the H-74 .. H-79 vector scaling; a non-identity reference becomes a temporary long-term `ilRefPic` DPB entry for the picture. Colour mapping (H.8.1.4.4, colour-gamut scalability) is not implemented and is refused explicitly
- *(registry)* `make_decoder` accepts `hvcC` extradata followed by an `lhvC` record (`parse_lhvc`, `parse_hvcc_with_len`) — the extradata a layered HEIF item (`lhv1`, e.g. a stereo / spatial photo) resolves to — and the `layer=<id>` / `view=<ViewId>` / `ols=<idx>` options; every output layer of the target is emitted, the layers of one access unit consecutively by increasing `nuh_layer_id`, the reorder bound scaled by the number of output layers
- *(fuzz)* `parse_annexb` now exercises the Annex F paths: every VPS is kept by id, an SPS parses through `parse_layered` with its NAL unit's `nuh_layer_id` (the multilayer-extension form and the VPS-inferred representation format), and every slice header through `parse_layered` with the `SliceLayerContext` of the SPS's VPS (inter-layer prediction block, `poc_reset_*` header extension); two seeds added (the stereo MV-HEVC parameter sets + slice heads, the self-built SHVC stream)
- *(tests)* self-built SHVC conformance stream (`encoder::layered_streams`, pinned as `tests/fixture_bytes/r462-shvc-2x.hevc`): a spatial-scalability VPS extension, a 32x32 PCM base layer and a 64x64 enhancement layer coded as an all-skip P picture over the resampled base — the decoded enhancement picture equals an independent `resample_picture` of the decoded base (no black-box SHVC producer exists on this machine; the resampler is validated for self-consistency, constant / bit-depth / ramp-midpoint properties and the H-74 vector scaling)

- *(sps)* Annex F `seq_parameter_set_rbsp( )` for `nuh_layer_id > 0` (`SeqParameterSet::parse_layered`): `sps_ext_or_max_sub_layers_minus1` → `MultiLayerExtSpsFlag`, the VPS-inferred profile / sub-layer count / representation format (`update_rep_format_flag` / `sps_rep_format_idx` → chroma format, picture size, bit depths, conformance window from the VPS `rep_format( )`) and sub-layer ordering info, `sps_infer_scaling_list_flag` / `sps_scaling_list_ref_layer_id`, and the `sps_multilayer_extension( )` body decoded in place (the SCC body behind it now decodes in place too; only an Annex I 3D body keeps the opaque tail); `SeqParameterSet::with_rep_format` applies the F.7.4.3.2.1 dependent-layer override at activation
- *(pps)* `pps_multilayer_extension( )` decoded in place (`PpsMultilayerExtension`): `poc_reset_info_present_flag`, `pps_infer_scaling_list_flag` / `pps_scaling_list_ref_layer_id`, the per-layer `RefLocOffset` set (scaled reference layer offsets, reference region offsets, resampling phases — an absent vertical chroma phase stays `None` for the F.7.4.3.3.4 geometry-dependent inference) and the `colour_mapping_table( )` with its `colour_mapping_octants( )` recursion (`CMResLSBits`, eq. F-50 residuals), bounded by the F.7.4.3.3.4/5 ranges
- *(slice)* Annex F slice segment header (`SliceSegmentHeader::parse_layered` with a `SliceLayerContext` built from the VPS): the `nuh_layer_id`-gated `slice_pic_order_cnt_lsb` of a non-base IDR, `inter_layer_pred_enabled_flag` / `num_inter_layer_ref_pics_minus1` / `inter_layer_pred_layer_idc[ ]` with the eq. F-52 .. F-54 `NumActiveRefLayerPics` / `RefPicLayerId[ ]` derivation, the eq. F-56 `NumPicTotalCurr` (inter-layer pictures AND the `pps_curr_pic_ref_enabled_flag` currPic term) for the `ref_pic_lists_modification( )` gate, `discardable_flag` / `cross_layer_bla_flag` accessors, and the typed header extension (`poc_reset_idc`, `poc_reset_period_id`, `full_poc_reset_flag`, `poc_lsb_val`, `poc_msb_cycle_val_present_flag` incl. the eq. F-55 inference, `poc_msb_cycle_val`) on both the independent and dependent segment paths — pinned on the two-view stream's layer-1 IDR_N_LP (a P slice from the base view) and TRAIL_R (a B slice: one temporal + one inter-layer reference) headers with truncation / bit-flip sweeps

- *(vps)* Annex F `vps_extension( )` decoded in full (`vps_ext`): F.7.3.2.1.1 syntax incl. `rep_format( )`, `dpb_size( )`, `vps_vui( )` (with `video_signal_info( )` and the bitstream-partition HRD walk), and the F.7.4.3.1.1 derived layer model (`LayerModel`: `LayerIdxInVps`, Table F.1 scalability ids / `ViewId` / `NumViews`, direct + transitive dependency matrices, tree partitions, base + additional layer sets, output layer sets with `OutputLayerFlag` / `NecessaryLayerFlag` / `OlsHighestOutputLayerId`, eq. F-14 inter-layer sample / motion prediction gates); `HevcVps` gains `extension` / `vps_extension2_flag` (the opaque tail now holds only the `vps_extension2_flag`-gated data); every loop bounded by the F.7.4.3.1.1 ranges; pinned on a two-view stream from an OS media framework's stereo encoder (Multiview Main second view, VPS VUI) plus a truncation / bit-flip robustness sweep

## [0.0.11](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav-h265/compare/v0.0.10...v0.0.11) - 2026-09-25

### Added

- *(encoder)* accept YuvJ420P as the full-range twin of Yuv420P, signalling video_full_range_flag by default
- *(encoder)* §E.2.1 video_signal_type VUI (range + H.273 colour description) and parameter-set-id options on every mode
- *(encoder)* halve the mode-decision λ under rd >= 1 and score the 64x64 search by SATD + bins — the 12 MP still lands −1.4 % BD-rate from the third-party encoder
- *(encoder)* intra mode-decision effort levels — SATD + signalling-bins rough decision, chroma-mode election, short-list full RD (12 MP still: +6.3 % -> +0.3 % BD-rate vs a third-party encoder)
- *(encoder)* registry tiles=CxR / wpp options — 12 MP still 17.7 s -> 3.4 s on 8 workers
- *(encoder)* any-size stills (padding + conformance window), Main Still Picture signalling, Table A.8 side-bound levels; SEI num_sps_ids bound
- *(decoder)* conformance-window output cropping + HEIF/HEIC still-picture pins (25 vendored real-world stills, both transport paths)
- *(encoder)* tile-parallel pass 1 under the core ExecutionContext contract
- *(encoder)* encoder-side WPP and tiles on the quadtree coder (wpp / tiles)
- *(encoder)* weighted prediction estimation (wp) — §7.3.6.3 pred_weight_table from fade detection
- *(encoder)* scaling-list-aware quantization (sl) — default + custom §7.3.4 lists
- *(encoder)* deeper transform hierarchy (tudepth) + 8x4 / 4x8 inter PUs in the quadtree ladder
- *(encoder)* RDOQ on the quadtree coder (rdoq)
- *(encoder)* sign data hiding on the quadtree coder (sdh)

### Other

- round-456 status — quantization / hierarchy / weighted-prediction / WPP-tile tools, composed pins, unit-test count
- *(encoder)* round-456 tool pins — composed RDOQ/SDH/tu2/WP/WPP pyramid + tiles/scaling-list/AQ low-delay streams, black-box validated
- *(examples)* rd_measure — BD-rate harness over a deterministic synthetic corpus

### Added

- *(decoder)* §7.4.3.2.1 conformance-window output cropping: `DecodedFrame` carries the active SPS's `CropWindow` (`DecodedFrame::output_picture`, `Picture::cropped`), the registry decoder emits the cropped `VideoFrame` (a 334x218 HEIF still coded as 336x224 comes out 334x218, as a HEIF reader expects) and the `decode_annexb` example writes the cropped planes; `decode_annexb_sequence` keeps returning the coded-size picture beside the window
- *(decoder)* `ProfileTierLevel` now exposes `general_profile_compatibility_flags` and the 48-bit `general_constraint_indicator_flags` (the `hvcC` fields), with `profile_compatible`, `one_picture_only_constraint_flag` and `is_still_picture_profile` helpers
- *(tests)* HEIF/HEIC still-picture interop pins (`tests/heic_stills.rs`, 25 vendored streams from three real-world producers, 232 KB): Main / Main 10 / Main Still Picture / RExt stills at 8 / 10 / 12 bits, 4:2:0 / 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 / monochrome, lossless, conformance windows, 2x2 and 18x14 pictures, CTB 16 + slices + WPP, transform skip + `cu_transquant_bypass` + RDOQ, tool-off axes, 8x8 quantization groups with chroma QP offsets, VUI timing + HRD + AUD + SEI — byte-exact against a black-box reference decoder on the Annex B path AND the `hvcC` length-prefixed path; the local matrix behind them is 134 streams (2x2 .. 8000x2000 and 12 MP grid tiles), 133 byte-exact and one where the reference decoder differs by a single chroma sample per plane while the stream's own decoded-picture-hash SEI agrees with this crate

- *(encoder)* any-size input on every registry mode: the coded picture is the caller's size rounded up to a multiple of 16 (edge-replicated padding) and a §7.4.3.2.1 conformance window (`SpsCfg::conformance_window`, `PcmAuOptions::conformance_window`, `LowDelayPEncoder` / `PyramidEncoder::with_conformance_window`) crops it back — to the even rounding of an odd size, 4:2:0 crops being in units of two luma samples; `general_level_idc` now honours the §A.4.1 b) / c) side bound `Sqrt( MaxLumaPs * 8 )` and the Table A.8 levels 6.3 / 7 / 7.2
- *(encoder)* `still` option (pcm / intra modes; `SpsCfg::still`, `PcmAuOptions::still`): Annex A.3.4 Main Still Picture signalling — `general_profile_idc == 3` with the Main / Main 10 / Main Still Picture compatibility flags and `general_one_picture_only_constraint_flag` (so Main 10 Still Picture decoders accept it too), a one-picture DPB (`sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1 == 0` in VPS and SPS) — the profile HEIF `hvc1` image items carry; golden pins in `tests/still_encoder.rs` (intra CTB 64 + loop filters, and lossless PCM, on a 333x217 picture), both byte-exact through a black-box reference decoder and accepted at 334x218 by three third-party HEIF readers once wrapped in a minimal container

- *(encoder)* intra mode-decision effort (`TreeCfg::with_intra_rd`, registry `rd` 0..=2; a `still` defaults to 2, everything else to the byte-stable historical level 0): level 1 replaces the SAD mode search by SATD (4x4 / 8x8 Hadamard kernels) + λ·§7.3.8.5 signalling bins (most-probable modes priced at 2 / 3 bins, the rest at 6) and elects `intra_chroma_pred_mode` (planar / 26 / 10 / 1 / derived, Table 8-2 substitution) by Cb + Cr SATD; level 2 additionally codes a short list of luma modes (3 at 4x4 / 8x8, 2 above, plus the most-probable mode) for real through the RD-elected RQT with per-candidate chroma election and keeps the cheapest — on the 1024x768 photograph −3.1 % / −4.2 % BD-rate (levels 1 / 2, QP 22..42) at 1.3x / 2.2x the wall time, on the 4032x3024 one −4.6 % / −5.6 % (QP 27..37; level 2 lands +0.3 % BD-rate from a third-party HEIF encoder's default preset, level 0 was +6.3 %) at 24 s / 38 s serial and 8.3 s with `tiles=4x4` on 8 workers; with the mode-decision λ halved under levels 1 / 2 (a 25..125 % sweep, optimum at one half: a further −1.5 % / −1.0 % on the two stills) level 2 ends at **−1.4 % BD-rate against the third-party encoder on the 12 MP still**; the 64x64 CU search scores by the same SATD + bins criterion; the coded `intra_chroma_pred_mode` bins now reach the emitter (Table 9-46) and the chroma TBs' scan follows `IntraPredModeC`
- *(encoder)* §E.2.1 `video_signal_type` VUI on encode (`VideoSignal`; registry `range=full|limited`, `colorprim` / `transfer` / `matrix` H.273 code points; `PcmAuOptions::video_signal`, `LowDelayPEncoder` / `PyramidEncoder::with_video_signal`): `video_full_range_flag` and the colour description every mode's SPS can now carry — an OS image reader takes the sample range from this field, so a full-range still rendered video-range-expanded without it; a full-range gradient still now reports `pc` range in a black-box probe and renders through the OS reader within rounding of the source
- *(encoder)* `YuvJ420P` (full-range) input accepted as the twin of `Yuv420P` on every mode — same sample path, the output pixel format echoed, and `video_full_range_flag == 1` written by default (an explicit `range` option wins); the 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 `YuvJ*` twins stay refused until those coders exist
- *(encoder)* parameter-set ids on encode (`ParameterSetIds`; registry `vpsid` / `spsid` / `ppsid` 0..=15 / 0..=15 / 0..=63; `PcmAuOptions::ids`, `LowDelayPEncoder` / `PyramidEncoder::with_parameter_set_ids`): VPS / SPS / PPS and every slice header carry the chosen ids on every mode, so a container can give sibling streams (an image and its alpha plane) distinct parameter sets
- *(encoder)* registry `tiles=CxR` / `wpp` options (they were documented since round 456 but never parsed — only the direct `TreeCfg` API reached the tools): a 4032x3024 still at QP 32 goes from 17.7 s to 3.4 s wall with `tiles=4x4` under an 8-worker `ExecutionContext` (+0.13 % bytes; the bytes never depend on the worker count), 2x2 on 4 workers 5.9 s
- *(examples)* `encode_still` — any-size 4:2:0 picture through the registry encoder with `key=value` options and a `threads=N` fan-out knob, reporting bytes + wall time (the still-picture RD / speed harness)

### Fixed

- *(sei)* `active_parameter_sets` bounds `num_sps_ids_minus1` to the §D.3.23 range 0..=15 (`SeiError::ValueOutOfRange`); an unbounded count sized an 11 GiB allocation under the scheduled fuzz run (`parse_annexb` OOM artifact, now rejected)

### Changed

- *(package)* `tests/` and `fuzz/` are excluded from the published crate (crates.io size cap; the vendored streams stay in the repository)

- *(encoder)* tile-parallel pass 1 under the core `ExecutionContext` contract: the quadtree coder decides the tiles of a picture independently (own state, own shadow coder, per-tile pro-rata CTU-rate budget) on up to `threads` workers (`LowDelayPEncoder` / `PyramidEncoder::with_threads`, `Encoder::set_execution_context` on the registry encoder), merged in tile-scan order — serial by default and bit-identical for any budget (CI-pinned); the decode-side `PuMvContext` closures gained `Sync` bounds
- *(encoder)* encoder-side WPP and tiles on the quadtree coder (`TreeCfg::with_wpp` / `with_tiles`, `TileLayout::uniform` / `explicit`, registry `wpp` / `tiles=CxR`): §6.5.1 tile-scan coding with availability cut at tile boundaries, §9.3.2.1 context re-initialization per tile and §9.3.2.2 / §9.3.2.5 WPP storage after the second CTB of a tile row + synchronization at the next row start, `end_of_subset_one_bit` + byte alignment between subsets, §7.3.6.1 entry points on I / P / B slice headers, §8.6.1 `qPY_PREV` resets per tile / WPP row, tile-gated SAO merge candidates, the shadow (rate-feedback / RDOQ) coder walking the same subset structure; picture-wide in-loop filters (`loop_filter_across_tiles_enabled_flag == 1`); WPP costs +1.1 % bytes, 2x2 tiles +3.9 % on the corpus (pyramid CTB 32). The `split_cu_flag` / `cu_skip_flag` ctxInc neighbours now take §6.4.1 availability (a tile-boundary desync fixed before release)
- *(encoder)* weighted prediction estimation (`TreeCfg::with_weighted_pred`, registry `wp`): PPS `weighted_pred_flag` / `weighted_bipred_flag`, per-reference luma + chroma weights fitted by motion-robust moment matching (fade detection, §7.3.6.3 `pred_weight_table( )` writer incl. the eq. 7-58 chroma-offset inverse), luma-weighted reference copies for the motion search and the decoder's own §8.5.3.3.4.3 combine (uni and bi) for the exact prediction — −26 % / −44 % BD-rate on the fading scene (pyramid / low-delay), −7.5 % / −14 % mean over the corpus
- *(encoder)* scaling-list-aware quantization on the quadtree coder (`TreeCfg::with_scaling_lists`, registry `sl` 0..=3): the §7.4.5 default lists (`scaling_list_enabled_flag` alone) or a flattened / steepened custom family transmitted through a §7.3.4 `scaling_list_data( )` writer; the deadzone quantizer, RDOQ and sign hiding all price each position at its `ScalingFactor` (Table 7-3 / 7-4 matrix selection), the reconstruction taking the decoder's own scaled dequantization — default lists trade −15 % bytes for −1..−3 dB luma PSNR (an HVS weighting, not a PSNR tool)
- *(encoder)* deeper transform hierarchy (`max_transform_hierarchy_depth_intra/inter` 1..=3 with RQT RDO at every node, `TreeCfg::with_tu_depth`, registry `tudepth`) and 8x4 / 4x8 inter PUs in the quadtree ladder (uni-pred per §8.5.3.2.2 step 10 / Table 9-46); `tudepth` 2 / 3 measure −0.9 % / −1.8 % BD-rate on top of rdoq+sdh (pyramid CTB 64)
- *(encoder)* RDOQ on the quadtree coder — per-TB level decisions under D + λ·R over the exact §7.3.8.11 bin costs at the shadow emission's CABAC context states (Table 9-52-derived integer bin-cost model), last-position election and coded-sub-block zero-out (`TreeCfg::with_rdoq`, registry `rdoq`); −9.4 % / −5.5 % / −7.9 % BD-rate on the pyramid / low-delay / all-intra paths of the `rd_measure` corpus
- *(encoder)* sign data hiding (`sign_data_hiding_enabled_flag`) on the quadtree coder — §7.3.8.11 `signHidden` sub-blocks omit their first sign, the levels parity-adjusted by the cheapest ±1 move (`TreeCfg::with_sign_hiding`, registry `sdh`); the residual encoder gains the hidden-sign path with a parity guard
- *(examples)* `rd_measure` — BD-rate harness over a deterministic synthetic corpus with decoder-exactness checks and .hevc/.yuv dumps for black-box validation

### Added — CTU-level rate feedback (`cturc`), round 453 (2026-08-31)

`with_ctu_rate_control` on both GOP encoders / the registry `cturc`
option (quadtree coder + rate control): inside every picture a shadow
CABAC emission of each coded CTB tracks the running coded size
against the controller's pro-rata frame budget, and the next CTB's
`QpY` moves off `SliceQpY (+ AQ)` by up to ±3 through §7.3.8.14
`cu_qp_delta` (one quantization group per CTB, the §8.6.1 `qPY_PREV`
thread mirrored into the deblocking QP map). Composes with AQ, TMVP,
VBV / HRD (the whole-AU caps still hold). Measured on a
flat-left / busy-right 64x64 pan, 40 frames at 120 kb/s: 23 782 vs
23 856 bytes for 24 000 targeted, P-frame size coefficient of
variation 0.61 → 0.50. A 12-frame stream is byte-exact through a
black-box reference decoder and CI-pinned. Also: the low-delay SPS
now signals `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1 = refs` (it had kept
the two-reference value under `with_refs(3..4)`; the refs-4 pin was
re-validated).

### Added — adaptive / non-dyadic mini-GOPs on the pyramid path, round 453 (2026-08-30)

`PyramidEncoder` takes any mini-GOP length in 2..=16 (the registry
`pyramid` option likewise): non-dyadic lengths run the same midpoint
schedule, and the SPS `sps_max_num_reorder_pics` /
`sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1` are derived exactly from the
schedule's reorder depth and retained-reference maximum (`reorder_delay`
exposes the dts lag). `with_adaptive_gop` / the `adaptivegop` option
closes a mini-GOP at a scene cut (luma MAD between consecutive input
frames > 4x the running average and > 16/sample): the frames before
the cut are coded as a shorter mini-GOP and the cut frame opens the
next, so no B slice straddles the cut. The flush tail is now coded as
a short mini-GOP instead of a low-delay P chain (the r451 HRD pyramid
pin's four-frame tail became `P, B, B, B`, 5 % smaller; re-validated
black-box). The §E.2.2/§D.2.3 HRD signalling holds for every length
(the conformance replay covers the tails).

### Added — non-uniform tile-grid encoding, round 453 (2026-08-30)

`PcmAuOptions::tile_spans`: explicit per-column widths / per-row
heights (in CTBs) put the tiled single-slice PCM picture on a
`uniform_spacing_flag == 0` grid — the PPS carries
`column_width_minus1[]` / `row_height_minus1[]`, the CTB walk follows
the §6.5.1 explicit boundaries (per-tile §7.3.8.1 subsets, §9.3.2.2
context re-initialization, §7.4.7.1 entry points as before). Spans
must partition the picture exactly (validated). A 3x2 explicit-grid
stream is lossless through a black-box reference decoder and
CI-pinned.

### Added — encoder temporal MVP + multi-reference lists, round 453 (2026-08-30)

`with_temporal_mvp` / the registry `tmvp` option: the SPS signals
`sps_temporal_mvp_enabled_flag`, every P / B slice
`slice_temporal_mvp_enabled_flag == 1` with the §7.3.6.1
`collocated_from_l0_flag` / `collocated_ref_idx` block (collocated
`RefPicList0[0]` on low-delay / anchor slices, `RefPicList1[0]` on
pyramid B slices), each reference now retains its decoded motion
field (`FrameRecon::motion_field`), and the §8.5.3.2.8 temporal
merge / AMVP candidates enter every PU election through the decode-
side derivation. `with_refs(n)` / the `refs` option (1..=4): the
low-delay path keeps `n` past references, the hierarchical-B path
builds `RefPicList0` / `RefPicList1` per §8.3.4 from the retained
pictures (past-then-future / future-then-past, cycled, truncated to
`num_ref_idx_lX_active`), the inline RPS marks the used sets, TR
`ref_idx_lX` is coded beyond two references, and motion estimation
runs per reference. Three golden streams (low-delay B refs 4 + TMVP
+ filters; GOP-8 pyramid refs 2 + TMVP; CTB-32 quadtree pyramid refs
3 + TMVP + filters + AQ) are byte-exact through a black-box reference
decoder and CI-pinned.

### Changed — two-start integer motion search, round 453

The integer search runs two starts and keeps the cheaper refined
result: the seed set (predictors, merge candidates, zero) and a
subsampled grid scan (every second position over ±24 luma samples,
2x2-subsampled SAD on 16x16+ blocks); each start is refined by a
coarse-to-fine square search (steps 8 / 4 / 2) then the small
diamond. On a periodic pan the old greedy diamond sat in wrong
minima at 2–8-frame distances and the hierarchical-B pyramid coded
the residual instead (a layer-2 B frame at the cost of its P anchor);
measured on 9 CIF frames at QP 27 / 32 the GOP-8 pyramid moves from
113 286 / 57 847 bytes to 63 297 / 37 619 at equal-or-better PSNR
(with temporal MVP: 61 792 / 37 484; CTB-64 quadtree + 2 refs + TMVP:
55 512 / 32 946 at +0.2 / +0.6 dB). Motion λ = 3·isqrt(mode λ)/2
(the 1× weight cost ~8 % low-delay rate at QP 32 once far minima were
reachable). Every inter golden pin was regenerated and re-validated
black-box.

### Fixed — motion-search λ collapsed the search above QP 35, round 453

The integer / fractional motion search and the merge / AMVP elections
priced mvd bins with the SSD-domain mode λ against SAD distortion;
from QP 36 a 16x16 block could not pay for any non-zero mvd, the
search returned the zero vector and every CTB fell back to intra (a
CIF P frame cost as much as its IDR: 9 frames at QP 37 went
153 336 → 21 873 bytes at 25.5 → 25.2 dB after the fix). The motion λ
is now the integer square root of the mode λ; below QP 36 the
operating points move by < 0.2 %. The affected golden pins were
regenerated and re-validated black-box (notes updated).

### Added — recursive coding-quadtree encoder (CTB 32/64), round 453 (2026-08-30)

A new `encoder::ctu` coder (`with_tree` on both GOP encoders, the
registry `ctb` option: 16 / 32 / 64) codes I / P / B slices with real
§7.3.8.4 coding quadtrees: RD-elected `split_cu_flag` recursion from
the CTB down to `MinCbSizeY == 8` (full encoder-state rollback around
each trial), the whole skip / merge / AMVP / two-PU(+AMP) / intra CU
ladder at every node, recursive §7.3.8.8 residual quadtrees
(`max_transform_hierarchy_depth_* > 0` with the forced-split and
inference rules mirrored from the decode side, `blkIdx == 3` deferred
4x4 chroma included), §8.6.4 DST-VII 4x4 intra luma TUs (new forward
DST), and intra `PART_NxN`. Emission mirrors the decoder's parse tree
rule for rule — §9.3.4.2.2 ctxIncs off per-4x4 `CtDepth` / skip
cells, Table 9-45 `part_mode` forms, `inter_pred_idc` at ctxInc
`CtDepth`, TR `ref_idx`, §7.3.8.14 `delta_qp` once per quantization
group with the §8.6.1 `QpY` thread mirrored into per-CU deblocking
descriptors and a per-4x4 QP map. The loop-filter and AQ stages
generalized to any CTB size (clipped edge CTBs). Three golden streams
(intra CTB 64, P GOP CTB 32 + filters + AQ, hierarchical-B CTB 64 +
AMP; non-CTB-multiple geometries) are byte-exact through a black-box
reference decoder and CI-pinned; the historical fixed-geometry
streams stay byte-stable.

### Added — CBR delivery schedule (`cbr`) + filler data, round 451 (2026-08-24)

`with_cbr` on both GOP encoders / the registry `cbr` option (requires
`hrd`): the signalled schedule becomes constant-bit-rate
(`cbr_flag[0] == 1`) — the Annex C clock switches to back-to-back
eq. C-3 arrivals, mid-stream buffering periods emit initial delays
inside the two-sided eq. C-19 bound (`Floor(deltaTime90k) <= delay <=
Ceil(deltaTime90k)`), and the encoder pads channel underruns with
§7.3.4 filler-data NAL units after the VCL (the §C.4 condition-2
overflow floor: cumulative arrival must reach `removal(m+1) −
CpbSize/BitRate`; a filler-quantum of headroom is reserved under the
underflow cap, with `bufsize >= 2` frame intervals validated). The
conformance harness gained the CBR replay (C-3 arrivals, C-19 both
sides, filler-syntax checks, and a whole-timeline overflow check at
every pre-removal and post-arrival instant) — in the process the
two-sided C-19 bound caught and fixed a bytes-vs-bits accounting slip
in the harness's own AU sizing that the one-sided VBR checks could
not see. CBR streams decode byte-exact through the crate's decoder
(FD_NUT skipped) and a black-box reference decoder.

### Added — HRD signalling + Annex C conformance (`hrd`), round 451 (2026-08-24)

`with_hrd` on the low-delay AND pyramid encoders / the registry `hrd`
option (requires `bitrate` + `bufsize` + an explicit `fps`; all three
coding modes): the SPS VUI now declares a §E.2.2 `hrd_parameters( )`
delivery schedule — NAL HRD, one CPB at the target rate (rounded up
onto the eq. E-87 64 b/s lattice) and the VBV size (eq. E-88 16-bit
lattice), VBR, AU-level, fixed picture rate — every IRAP access unit
carries a §D.2.2 buffering-period SEI and every access unit a §D.2.3
pic-timing SEI (the pyramid's `pic_dpb_output_delay` encodes its
dyadic reorder schedule; the buffering periods keep `delay + offset`
constant per §D.3.2 with the eq. C-18 bound honoured at mid-stream
IRAPs). An exact integer Annex C clock (`encoder::hrd::HrdClock`,
u128 arithmetic over a common denominator — bit-deterministic, no
rounding) both emits those fields and hard-caps every access unit so
its final CPB arrival never passes its nominal removal: the §C.4
no-underflow condition holds by construction, composing with the VBV
re-encode loop. Self-checked by a bitstream-only §C.2 replay in CI
(`tests/hrd_conformance.rs`: parse the VUI/SEI back, replay arrivals
and removals exactly, assert §C.4 conditions 2 and 3, eq. C-18,
§D.3.2 delay bounds and display-order DPB output monotonicity across
low-delay / pyramid / all-intra / registry configurations) — and
validated black-box: a reference decoder accepts the SEI-bearing
streams (the SEI rides between the parameter sets and the slice, so
the context-dependent parse lands after SPS activation) and decodes
them byte-exact to the encoder reconstructions.

### Added — HRD golden pins (`r451-lowdelay-hrd` / `r451-pyramid-hrd`), round 451 (2026-08-24)

Two CI-pinned golden streams for the HRD arms, both validated out of
band against a black-box reference decoder at pin time (accepted
without warnings, decoded byte-exact to the encoder
reconstructions): a 30-frame low-delay GOP-10 stream at 150 kb/s /
12 kbit VBV with full HRD signalling (three buffering periods, so
the C-18-bounded mid-stream initial delays are pinned), and a
21-frame GOP-8 pyramid at 150 kb/s / 18 kbit VBV with AQ 2 and HRD
(the reorder schedule pinned in `pic_dpb_output_delay`).
Deterministic re-encodes must reproduce the bytes exactly.

### Added — hierarchical QP offsets on the wire + registry `pyramidstep`, round 451 (2026-08-24)

The pyramid's per-layer rate allocation is now a registry surface
(`pyramidstep`, 0..=6, default 1: `SliceQpY = base + layer * step`,
requires `pyramid`) and wire-verified: new tests parse every slice
header back (`slice_qp_delta` against the PPS `init_qp`) and assert
the signalled `SliceQpY` equals the layer allocation for flat /
default / steep steps, that a steeper step strictly shrinks the
deep-layer bit share while the layer-0 anchors stay byte-identical,
and that the offsets compose with spatial AQ + the in-loop filters
(per-CTB `cu_qp_delta` riding on per-layer slice QPs, bit-exact
through the crate's own decoder).

### Changed — pyramid ABR accuracy: per-slice base elections + measurement gates, round 451 (2026-08-24)

The hierarchical-B rate controller now elects a base QP per SLICE (at
its own decode instant) instead of once per mini-GOP; the per-layer
offsets still ride on top. New rate-accuracy measurement gates
(`tests/rate_accuracy.rs`: target vs achieved over the whole run AND
the converged tail, across low-delay / pyramid / VBV / VBV+HRD /
filters / AQ / B-slice configurations, plus a monotone 3-point rate
ladder and a roomy-VBV no-distortion gate) measured the once-per-GOP
election at ~20 % tail drift on a 120 kb/s pyramid — the bounded
excursion window can only move ±3 QP per election, which under-tracks
at a mini-GOP cadence and rings against the leaky-bucket correction.
With per-slice elections every matrix configuration lands within
1.6 % of target (low-delay within 1 %); gates pinned at 5/4 %
(low-delay) and 6/5 % (pyramid) whole/tail.

### Added — §D.2.2 / §D.2.3 buffering-period + pic-timing SEI parse, round 451 (2026-08-24)

`sei::BufferingPeriodSei::parse` / `sei::PicTimingSei::parse`: the two
HRD-initializing SEI messages are now decoded. Their syntax is
context-dependent (field widths and gating flags live in the active
`hrd_parameters( )`), so they parse from the verbatim payload bytes the
generic `parse_sei_rbsp` walk already surfaces as `Reserved`, against a
caller-supplied `HrdCommonInfo` — full coverage of the §D.2.2 body
(IRAP alternative delay/offset pairs, concatenation,
`au_cpb_removal_delay_delta_minus1`, NAL and VCL CPB sets) and the
§D.2.3 AU-level body (frame-field trio, `au_cpb_removal_delay_minus1`,
`pic_dpb_output_delay`, the sub-pic output-delay field).

### Added — VBV across B-pyramid GOPs (per-AU decode-instant accounting), round 451 (2026-08-24)

`bufsize` now composes with `pyramid` (the r449 rejection is lifted):
the hierarchical-B encoder enforces the modelled decoder buffer on
EVERY access unit at its own decode instant — the leading IDR, each
mini-GOP's anchor P and every B layer alike drain the model in decode
order and are re-encoded at a higher QP (+3 steps up to the ceiling)
whenever they would still underflow it, exactly the flat-GOP arm's
hard guarantee. The controller elects each slice's base QP at its
own decode instant (the per-layer offsets ride on top, keeping the
pyramid's rate-allocation shape) and aims it at 3/4 of the modelled
fullness, so the re-encode loop stays an emergency. Replay-pinned
like the r449
low-delay arm: the leaky bucket replayed over the decode-order
access units never underflows while the unconstrained twin provably
overshoots the buffer, and the streams stay bit-exact through the
crate's own decoder.

### Added — VBV-constrained rate control (`bufsize`), round 449 (2026-08-21)

`RateControlCfg::with_vbv` / the registry `bufsize` option (bits,
`k` / `M` suffixes; requires `bitrate`): the controller models a
decoder buffer of the given size filled at the target rate and
drained whole-frame at each decode instant. Frame budgets aim at 3/4
of the current fullness, and — the hard guarantee — the low-delay
and all-intra encoders RE-ENCODE a frame at increasing QP (+3 steps
up to the ceiling) whenever its access unit would still underflow
the modelled buffer, made possible by splitting `encode_frame` into
a side-effect-free `code_frame_at` plus a state commit. Pinned by a
leaky-bucket replay over a stream whose unconstrained twin provably
overshoots the buffer (no frame ever exceeds fullness, streams stay
bit-exact through the crate's decoder and a black-box reference
decoder, achieved rate within 0.4 % of target on the validation
clip). `bufsize` with `pyramid` is rejected for now (mini-GOP burst
coding needs per-slice budgeting).

### Added — SPS VUI frame-rate declaration (§E.2.1 `vui_timing_info`), round 449 (2026-08-21)

`LowDelayPEncoder::with_frame_rate` / `PyramidEncoder::with_frame_rate`
(and every registry mode when the `fps` option is explicitly given):
the SPS now carries `vui_parameters_present_flag == 1` with a minimal
§E.2.1 VUI body declaring `vui_num_units_in_tick = fps_den`,
`vui_time_scale = fps_num` — so players and probes see the intended
frame rate (verified black-box: a 30000/1001 stream probes as
30000/1001, and still decodes byte-exact). Streams without an
explicit rate stay VUI-free, keeping every golden pin byte-stable;
the declaration is parsed back bit-exact through the crate's own
§E.2.1 VUI decoder in CI.

### Added — adaptive quantization on the inter paths (P / low-delay B / pyramid), round 449 (2026-08-21)

`LowDelayPEncoder::with_aq` / `PyramidEncoder::with_aq` (and the
registry `aq` option now composing with `mode = "inter"`, `gop`,
`bslices`, `pyramid`, the in-loop filters AND `bitrate`): every
inter slice codes per-CTB QPs (slice/frame QP + the activity
offsets), emitting `cu_qp_delta` through the same §7.3.8.10 /
§9.3.3.10 write path as the intra landing — with the inter-specific
inference mirrored on the §8.6.1 chain: skip CUs,
`rqt_root_cbf == 0` AMVP/two-PU CUs and all-zero transform trees
transmit no delta and inherit the predicted QP (deblocking and the
running `qPY_PREV` both see the inherited value). Mode decisions
(merge/AMVP/intra competition, motion-search λ) run at each CTB's
own QP. Validated by bit-exact GOP roundtrips (P and low-delay B
with filters, pyramid composed with rate control, registry paths)
and an out-of-band black-box reference-decoder sweep (low-delay
gop=10 aq=2, B+filters aq=3, pyramid-8 aq=2+filters — all
byte-exact; ABR accuracy unchanged: 90-frame pyramid @300 kb/s
lands within 0.7 %).

### Added — spatial adaptive quantization: the encoder's first `cu_qp_delta` writer (intra), round 449 (2026-08-21)

`encode_idr_intra_au_aq` / the registry `aq` option (1..=3, `mode =
"intra"`): each CTB's `QpY` moves off the slice QP by `aq` QP per
octave of luma-activity ratio against the picture average (integer Q3
log2, clamped ±6, deterministic), spending relatively more bits on
flat regions where quantization error is most visible. This is the
encode side's first per-CTB QP signalling:

* the PPS gains `cu_qp_delta_enabled_flag` + `diff_cu_qp_delta_depth
  == 0` (one §7.4.9.14 quantization group per CTB);
* `encode_cu_qp_delta` writes the §9.3.3.10 `cu_qp_delta_abs`
  binarization (TR cMax-5 prefix over the two Table 9-24 contexts,
  bypass EG0 escape, bypass sign) — the bin-exact dual of the decode
  side, exercised through ±6 deltas (the escape path included);
* the encoder threads the §8.6.1 `qPY_PREV` chain (with one QG per
  CTB the neighbour prediction collapses to the previous CU in decode
  order), including the inference that a CTB with no coded cbf
  transmits nothing and inherits the predicted QP — mirrored for
  quantization, deblocking and the next prediction;
* the §8.7.2 deblocking descriptors now carry per-CTB effective QPs
  (both q- and p-side neighbour scalars), so QP-dependent filtering
  stays exact under AQ.

Validated differentially (every AQ stream decodes byte-exact through
this crate's own full §8.6.1/§8.7.2 decoder, across strengths, QPs
17..42 and filter configurations) and black-box (9 QP × strength
configurations byte-exact through a reference decoder). AQ never
loses quality in the flat region at equal slice QP (pinned).

### Added — pyramid-path rate control, round 449 (2026-08-21)

The hierarchical-B pyramid joins the ABR machinery:
`PyramidEncoder::with_rate_control(&RateControlCfg)` elects the BASE
QP once per mini-GOP (the per-layer offsets ride on top, keeping the
pyramid's rate-allocation shape while its level tracks the target),
and every coded slice feeds back at the base QP so the complexity
EWMA absorbs the layer-offset discount — the inversion at the next
election is unbiased. The low-delay flush tail elects per frame. The
registry `bitrate` / `fps` options now compose with `pyramid`
(the round-449 "not yet" carve-out is lifted); `PyramidAu::qp`
exposes each slice's QP. Validated by budget-accuracy + bit-exact
display-order roundtrip tests (GOP 4 / 8, filtered and not) and an
out-of-band black-box reference-decoder sweep (pyramid-8 @150k,
pyramid-4 + deblock/SAO @400k — both byte-exact, achieved rate
within 13 % on a 30-frame clip, converging with length).

### Added — average-bitrate rate control (`bitrate` / `fps`), round 449 (2026-08-21)

The encoder gains ABR targeting (`encoder::rate`): a deterministic,
integer-only controller (Q16 fixed point on the §8.6.3 quantizer
lattice, where the step is `2^(QP/6)`) that models each frame class's
coded size as `bits ≈ C / 2^(QP/6)`, folds every coded frame back
into a per-class complexity EWMA (intra and inter tracked
separately), and elects each frame's `SliceQpY` from the inverted
model under a leaky-bucket budget with bounded per-frame QP
excursions (a `min(2 + gap, 15)` window that widens with the frames
since the class last coded, so rare IDRs re-anchor within one refresh
while back-to-back frames move at most ±3). Rate control moves ONLY
the
per-slice `slice_qp_delta`, so every stream stays conforming and
bit-exact through the crate's own decoder.

* `LowDelayPEncoder::with_rate_control(&RateControlCfg)` — ABR on the
  low-delay P/B paths (GOP refresh, AMP and the §8.7 in-loop filters
  all compose); `EncodedPFrame::qp` exposes the per-frame election.
* Registry options `bitrate` (bits/s, `k` / `M` suffixes) and `fps`
  (`"25"` or `"30000/1001"`, default 25) on the `"inter"` and
  `"intra"` modes; an explicit `qp` option seeds the starting QP,
  otherwise it derives from the target bits per pixel. `fps` also
  sets the packet time base (previously hardwired to 1/25).
  `bitrate` with `"pcm"` or (for now) `pyramid` is rejected.
* Measured on a 96x64 noisy moving-square clip @25 fps: targets of
  60k / 100k / 250k / 600k b/s land within 1.4–6.2 % of the request,
  and every rate-controlled stream (P, low-delay B, filtered,
  GOP-refresh) decodes byte-exact through a black-box reference
  decoder and through this crate's decoder.
* New `encode_abr` example; validation in `tests/rate_control.rs`
  (accuracy, steady-state convergence, bounded QP tracks, bit-exact
  roundtrips, registry option errors) plus model unit tests.

### Fixed — §7.3.8.10 `tu_residual_act_flag` presence gate is a three-way disjunction, round 444 (2026-08-15)

The adaptive-colour-transform flag is present for a `MODE_INTER`
coding unit, OR a `PART_2Nx2N` intra CU whose
`intra_chroma_pred_mode[ x0 ][ y0 ]` is 4 (derived mode), OR an intra
CU whose four MinCb-quadrant `intra_chroma_pred_mode` values are all
4 — the `PART_NxN` derived-mode case. This decoder conjoined the last
two arms, so on ACT-enabled 4:4:4 SCC streams every `PART_NxN`
all-derived-mode intra CU skipped a context-coded bin and the CABAC
parse silently desynchronized — surfacing hundreds of coding units
later as palette-bound violations (`palette_predictor_run` /
`PaletteMaxRunMinus1` errors), which the r441 triage had recorded as
a palette-upstream desync. All 12 previously-erroring official SCC
bitstreams now parse end to end (the corpus 4:2:0/4:4:4 split was the
giveaway: ACT is 4:4:4-only). Byte-exactness of the SCC branch is
still open (reconstruction deltas from the first picture, all 15
streams); pinned by the `act_flag_gate_is_a_three_way_disjunction`
unit test.

### Fixed — §8.5.4.3 codes ONE chroma block per 4:4:4 transform unit, round 444 (2026-08-15)

The stacked upper/lower chroma-block pair of a transform unit exists
only for `ChromaArrayType == 2` (§8.5.4.3: `blkIdx` proceeds over
`0..( ChromaArrayType == 2 ? 1 : 0 )`). The inter residual-extraction
path keyed the pair on `SubHeightC == 1` — true for 4:2:2 AND 4:4:4 —
so on 4:4:4 every transform unit carrying a §7.3.8.12
`cross_comp_pred( )` with a cbf-clear chroma half synthesized a
phantom second §8.6.6 cross-component application one TU-height BELOW
the real block, corrupting the sibling region of the coding unit with
`( ResScaleVal * rY ) >> 3` offsets (chroma-only, inter pictures
only — the intra path already keyed on `ChromaArrayType == 2`, which
is why every intra frame stayed byte-exact and the r441 triage
mislocalized the divergence into chroma SAO).

One line, EIGHT official conformance streams (38/61 → **46/61**
byte-exact, the complete RExt branch): `CCP_{8,10,12}bit`,
`QMATRIX_A`, `Bitdepth_A/B` (the "Cr-only" divergence was this
phantom landing on Cr-active regions), `SAO_A_RExt`, and
`ExplicitRdpcm_A` (retiring the r437 "±1 chroma artifact under
investigation" note — the §8.6.5 direction was never at fault).
Regression-pinned by a split-tree unit test
(`ccp_444_uncoded_chroma_writes_single_block_not_stacked_halves`) and
the expanded `tests/conformance_official.rs` list (the sidecar
matcher now also reads the `<stem>_md5sum.txt` form those streams
publish).

### Fixed — §9.3.2.1 initialization priority at dependent-segment starts, round 441 (2026-08-12)

A dependent slice segment whose first CTU is the first CTU of a tile
RE-INITIALIZES the CABAC contexts / StatCoeff / palette predictor
(§9.3.2.2 / §9.3.2.3), and one whose first CTU starts a CTU row of a
tile under `entropy_coding_sync_enabled_flag` SYNCHRONIZES from the
§9.3.2.4 WPP snapshot — the §9.3.2.5 `TableStateIdxDs` restore is
only the LAST branch of §9.3.2.1, not the unconditional dependent-
segment behaviour this decoder applied. The WPP snapshot storage is
also picture-wide now: a CTU row started by a later slice segment of
the same slice synchronizes from the state stored while an earlier
segment decoded the row above (spatial-neighbour-T availability
gated, §6.4.1). Closes the `WAVETILES` official stream (its fourth
CVS packs wavefronts + tiles + 6-CTU dependent slice segments):
37/61 → **38/61** byte-exact.

### Fixed — §7.4.2.4.4 access-unit boundary on parameter-set NAL units, round 441 (2026-08-12)

A VPS / SPS / PPS NAL unit (`nuh_layer_id == 0`) succeeding a VCL NAL
unit **starts a new access unit**, so the pending picture is complete
and must be decoded before the arriving parameter set is activated.
The whole-bitstream driver deferred that decode to the next picture's
first slice — by which time a re-sent parameter set with the same id
and different content (the normal shape of multi-CVS conformance
streams and per-picture-PPS streams) had already overwritten the maps
the picture decode reads. Slice *headers* were parsed against the
right sets; the slice-data decode was not.

One fix, eleven official conformance streams (26/61 → **37/61**
byte-exact): both `EXTPREC_*_444_16_INTRA` families at 10/12/16 bit
(the 4:4:4 extended-precision matrix is now complete at every staged
depth), `GENERAL_{8,10,12}b_444`, `GENERAL_16b_400`, and
`PERSIST_RPARAM_A`; `QMATRIX_A` (twenty per-picture PPSs) improves
from 1/20 to 4/20 hash-correct frames. Regression-pinned by a two-CVS
same-ids different-geometry lossless roundtrip and the expanded
`tests/conformance_official.rs` list.

### Added / Fixed — official RExt + SCC conformance, round 437 (2026-08-04)

Round 437 triaged the staged official JCT-VC conformance corpus
(`docs/video/h265/conformance/`, 61 decodable RExt + SCC bitstreams
with published output digests) through the whole-bitstream decoder,
moving the byte-exact count from 12/61 to **26/61**:

- **§7.4.7.1 entry-point bound for tiles + wavefronts combined**: the
  slice-header range check treated the two partitioning flags as
  mutually exclusive; the combined case allows
  `NumTileColumns * PicHeightInCtbsY − 1` subsets. The six staged
  WPP-and-tile high-throughput streams now decode byte-exact.
- **§9.3.3.11 persistent Rice adaptation**
  (`persistent_rice_adaptation_enabled_flag`): `StatCoeff[ sbType ]`
  seeding (eqs. 9-20..9-23) and the uncapped eq. 9-25 adaptation,
  with the state carried in `ResidualContexts` so the §9.3.2.4/.5
  WPP / dependent-segment storage snapshots it.
- **§9.3.4.3.6 aligned bypass decoding**
  (`cabac_bypass_alignment_enabled_flag`): §7.3.8.11
  `escapeDataPresent` tracking and the `ivlCurrRange = 256` alignment
  before each sub-block's sign + remaining bypass run.
- **§9.3.3.4 limited EGk escape suffixes**
  (`extended_precision_processing_flag`): the eqs. 9-14..9-16
  binarization replacing the plain EGk escape.
- **Monochrome (4:0:0) reconstruction**: intra CUs no longer read the
  absent `intra_chroma_pred_mode`; the 8-bit / 12-bit
  Monochrome-profile streams decode byte-exact.
- **§9.3.4.2.8 palette run-prefix ctxInc** consumes the RAW signalled
  `palette_idx_idc` (inferred 0 when absent), not the eq. 7-84
  adjusted `CurrPaletteIndex`. The self-built r413 palette pins
  shared the bug symmetrically on the write side and were
  regenerated; the official palette-heavy SCC streams now parse
  substantially further (two to complete 33-frame decodes).
- **§8.6.1 `CuQpOffsetCb` / `CuQpOffsetCr` applied**: the parsed
  §7.3.8.15 `chroma_qp_offset( )` elements now feed
  eqs. 8-285..8-288 (per-slice state, decode-order updates from
  transform units and palette CUs, ACT bases included). Closes the
  `GENERAL_*_422` pair and both `Main_422_10` streams.
- **§8.7.2.5.5 chroma deblocking `cQpPicOffset`** is the PPS chroma
  offset alone — the slice/CU-level adjustments no longer leak into
  the tC derivation.
- `tests/conformance_official.rs` pins the 26 byte-exact streams
  (docs-gated: a no-op where the corpus is not staged), and the
  `conformance_scan` example triages the corpus with per-frame
  §D.2 decoded-picture-hash SEI scoring.
- The round also **disproves** the r413 "reference deviates on
  explicit-RDPCM vertical blocks" note: a black-box decode of the
  official `ExplicitRdpcm_A` stream reproduces the published digest
  exactly, and this crate's luma decode agrees byte-for-byte — the
  remaining divergence is a ±1 chroma artifact on isolated rows
  (under investigation), not the §8.6.5 direction.

### Added — encoder AMP + hierarchical-B pyramids, round 431 (2026-07-27)

- **Asymmetric motion partitions** (`LowDelayPEncoder::with_amp`,
  registry option `amp`): the AMP stream configuration signals
  `MinCbSizeY == 8` + `amp_enabled_flag == 1` — every CTB stays one
  UNSPLIT 16x16 CU behind an explicit §7.3.8.4 `split_cu_flag == 0`,
  inter `part_mode` moves to the Table 9-45 big-CU column (including
  the four AMP bin strings), and intra CUs above MinCb carry no
  `part_mode` (§7.3.8.5). The inter CU ladder elects
  `PART_2NxnU / PART_2NxnD / PART_nLx2N / PART_nRx2N` alongside the
  symmetric shapes through the same staged-motion-field per-PU
  merge/AMVP election and forced depth-1 RQT; the loop-filter CU
  descriptors carry the real AMP part modes. Measured at fixed
  geometry on quarter-offset motion-boundary content: −20.5 % /
  −28.9 % bytes at equal PSNR (qp 24 / 30).
- **Hierarchical-B GOPs** (`encoder::pyramid`, registry option
  `pyramid = 2/4/8/16`): one leading IDR, then dyadic mini-GOPs coded
  out of display order — next anchor first as a layer-0 P slice, then
  each interval's midpoint as a B slice with the past boundary on
  `RefPicList0` and the FUTURE boundary on `RefPicList1`, one layer
  deeper per halving, with per-layer QP offsets
  (`with_layer_qp_step`). Slices carry inline §7.4.8 short-term RPS
  with negative AND positive pictures (used flags on the active
  pair); the SPS/VPS signal `sps_max_num_reorder_pics = log2(gop)`
  and a DPB bound of `log2(gop) + 2`. Streaming `PyramidEncoder`
  (display-order in, decode-order AU bursts out, low-delay tail on
  `flush`) plus sequence-level `encode_pyramid[_with]`; registry
  packets follow the dts = decode-counter − log2(gop) law. On a
  noisy-pan clip at qp 27 the GOP-8 pyramid takes −11.5 % bytes vs
  the low-delay chain.
- **Two-sided AMVP** in the shared inter machinery: `SliceSpec` with
  explicit per-list reference sets and RPS content, dual-list
  prediction plumbing, per-list + bi AMVP search on two-sided B
  slices, and full Table 9-47 `inter_pred_idc` emission
  (`PRED_L0` / `PRED_L1` / `PRED_BI`) with the L1
  `ref_idx/mvd/mvp` syntax group. Motion-field cells now stamp the
  true referenced POCs (`ref_poc(list, idx)`, as the decoder does).
- **Validation**: AMP and pyramid roundtrips across QP x slice-type x
  filter sweeps decode bit-exactly through the crate's own decoder
  (display order for the pyramids, via the §C.5.2.2 output ordering);
  ten configurations cross-checked byte-exact out of band against a
  black-box reference HEVC decoder; three new golden interop pins
  (AMP P-GOP, GOP-4 pyramid, GOP-8 pyramid x AMP x deblock/SAO).
  Legacy streams are byte-identical (existing golden pins
  untouched); `FrameStats` gains the `amp` counter.

### Added — encoder in-loop filters, round 429 (2026-07-25)

- **§8.7.2 deblocking on the encoder's reconstruction path**
  (`encoder::loopfilter`): every filtered frame runs the crate's own
  DECODE-side `deblock_picture_full` over per-CTB descriptors built
  from the coding decisions (partition mode, transform-split
  topology, the per-transform-block nonzero-coefficient marks the
  §8.7.2.4 bS derivation reads), so the encoder's reference pictures
  match a conforming decoder's bit for bit. The per-slice election is
  distortion-driven over off plus a {−2, 0, 2}²
  `slice_beta_offset_div2` / `slice_tc_offset_div2` sweep, signalled
  through the §7.3.6.1 deblocking override group (PPS
  `deblocking_filter_override_enabled_flag == 1`, default disabled).
- **§8.7.3 SAO estimation + emission on the encoder side**:
  statistics-driven per-CTB offset derivation (band position by
  per-band gain, the four edge classes with the §7.4.9.3
  inferred-sign clamps, chroma under the shared-type rule, whole-CTB
  merge-left/up candidates priced as well), every candidate's
  distortion measured with the decoder's own `apply_sao_ctb_full`
  and the elected grid applied through `apply_sao_picture_full`.
  `encode_sao_ctb` is the bin-exact §7.3.8.3 `sao( rx, ry )` dual of
  `decode_sao`, differential-tested against it. Slice-level
  `slice_sao_luma_flag` / `slice_sao_chroma_flag` election drops the
  per-CTB syntax entirely when no CTB benefits.
- **Wiring**: `encode_idr_intra_au_lf` and
  `LowDelayPEncoder::with_loop_filters` (public `LoopFilterCfg`);
  registry options `deblock` / `sao` on the `intra` and `inter`
  modes; both encoders restructured into decide → filter → emit
  passes so the filter elections are known before the slice header
  is written. `LoopFilterCfg::off()` is byte-identical with the
  legacy unfiltered output (golden pins unchanged).
- **Validation**: filtered P and B GOPs (deblock-only / SAO-only /
  both, QP 17..40, mid-stream IDR refreshes, square + non-square
  geometries) decode bit-exactly to the encoder's filtered
  reconstruction through the crate's own decoder AND a black-box
  reference decoder (72/72-configuration out-of-band sweep); three
  golden filtered streams pinned
  (`tests/loopfilter_encoder_interop.rs`). On the interop clip the
  filters buy up to +1.5 dB luma PSNR at equal rate (QP 22).

### Added — Rext/SCC application tail, round 416 (2026-07-17)

- **Cross-component prediction is now APPLIED, not just parsed**
  (§8.6.6, 4:4:4 only): the §7.3.8.12 `cross_comp_pred( )` results
  (`ResScaleVal` per chroma component) modify the chroma residuals of
  each transform unit from its co-located luma residual per
  eq. 8-324, on both the intra path (§8.4.4.1 step 8, after the
  step-7 §8.6.5 modification) and the inter residual-extraction path
  (§8.5.4.3 step 5). A chroma transform block whose cbf is clear
  still receives the scaled luma residual. The eq. 8-324
  `( rY << BitDepthC ) >> BitDepthY` bit-depth alignment runs in
  64-bit intermediates so extended-precision coefficient ranges
  cannot overflow.
- **Adaptive colour transform decode, end to end** (§8.6.8, 4:4:4
  SCC): a `tu_residual_act_flag == 1` transform unit now derives its
  three co-located residual arrays with the ACT-adjusted quantization
  parameters (eq. 8-291 luma clip-and-offset, eq. 8-287/8-288 chroma
  offset-base swap to `PpsActQpOffset* + slice_act_*_qp_offset`),
  applies cross-component prediction first, then the §8.6.8.2 inverse
  colour transformation (input coefficient-range clips, lossy
  bit-depth alignment with the eq. 8-334/8-335 chroma pre-scale, the
  eq. 8-336..8-339 lifting, and the rounded down-shift), on both the
  intra reconstruction and inter residual-extraction paths. cbf-clear
  components are materialized so the transform's cross-component
  mixing reaches them.
- **Intra block copy decode, end to end** (SCC
  `pps_curr_pic_ref_enabled_flag`): the §8.3.4 reference lists append
  the current picture per eqs 8-8/8-9/8-10 (with the eq. 8-9 closing
  override and the unguarded temp-list append), `NumPicTotalCurr`
  counts it (§7.4.7.2), the slice header parses
  `use_integer_mv_flag`, motion vectors referencing the current
  picture (or any, with `use_integer_mv_flag`) take the integer-
  resolution paths (AMVP eqs 8-98..8-101, merge eqs 8-124/8-125), the
  current picture reads as a long-term reference for the candidate
  derivations, the §8.5.3.2.1 eqs 8-102/8-103 8×8 bi→uni reduction is
  active under `TwoVersionsOfCurrDecPicFlag` (eq. 7-40), and
  prediction from the current picture copies the pre-in-loop-filter
  reconstruction via a per-CU snapshot (exact, since the §8.5.3.1
  availability constraints bound every referenced sample to precede
  the coding block in z-scan order).
- **Three self-built conformance pins** (`tests/fixture_bytes/
  r416-*.hevc` + whole-bitstream axis tests): a 4:4:4 lossless CCP
  stream sweeping every ResScaleVal magnitude/sign (byte-exact
  through a black-box reference decode), a 4:4:4 lossless ACT stream
  alternating `tu_residual_act_flag`, and a 4:2:0 lossless IBC
  stream (an IDR whose P slice lists only the current picture). The
  surveyed black-box reference decoder rejects SCC streams outright,
  so the ACT / IBC pins are decoder-pins (r413 palette precedent).

### Fixed — round 416

- The sequence driver hardcoded
  `residual_adaptive_colour_transform_enabled_flag` to `false` in
  the slice-data parse params, so `tu_residual_act_flag` was never
  read from the wire (CABAC desync on any real ACT stream). It now
  propagates from the PPS SCC extension.

### Changed — public-surface hygiene (2026-07-17)

- Internal plumbing modules (CABAC / binarization / reconstruction /
  parameter-set parsers / write-side encoder building blocks) and
  their crate-root re-exports are now `#[doc(hidden)]`: they stay
  `pub` for tests / fuzz targets but are no longer part of the stable
  API. The stable surface is the registry pair (`register`,
  `make_decoder` / `make_encoder`), the `decoder` / `encoder`
  (incl. `encoder::{pcm,intra,inter}`) / `sequence` / `picture` /
  `nal` / `hvcc` modules, the crate-root `Error`, and the error types
  those surfaces carry. No semantic or signature changes.

### Added — decode-conformance round 413 (2026-07-14)

- **SCC palette-mode decode, end to end** (`palette` module): the
  §7.3.8.5 `palette_mode_flag` gate, the full §7.3.8.13
  `palette_coding( )` parse (predictor reuse runs, new entries, the
  §9.3.3.14 index-count and §9.3.3.6 truncated-binary index
  binarizations, copy-above / explicit index runs with the §9.3.4.2.8
  run-prefix contexts, per-run eq. 7-83/7-84 index adjustment, both
  escape binarizations, and the in-palette `delta_qp( )` /
  `chroma_qp_offset( )`), the §8.4.4.2.7 reconstruction (transpose,
  eq. 8-77 escape dequantization clamped per component QP), and the
  palette predictor machinery — §9.3.2.3 initialization from PPS /
  SPS initializers, eq. 8-79 per-CU update, and §9.3.2.4/.5 WPP /
  dependent-slice storage & synchronization (the predictor travels
  inside `SliceContexts`, re-initialized at slice / tile / WPP-row
  context re-init points). Palette CUs record `INTRA_DC` for §8.4.2
  neighbour derivation and honour the transquant-bypass loop-filter
  suppression. Pinned by a self-built twelve-CU lossless conformance
  stream (`tests/fixture_bytes/r413-palette.hevc`) — no black-box
  encoder or decoder in this workspace supports SCC palette, see the
  generation notes. A second pin (`r413-palette-init.hevc`) covers
  the §9.3.2.3 SPS predictor initializers, per-independent-slice
  predictor re-initialization, and the §9.3.3.14 all-ones-prefix
  index-count escape.

- **§8.6.5 RDPCM reconstruction** (range-extensions residual
  modification for transform-bypass blocks), closing the round-410
  followup: inter blocks with `explicit_rdpcm_flag == 1` apply the
  directional accumulation with mDir = `explicit_rdpcm_dir_flag`
  (§8.5.4.2 / §8.5.4.3), and intra transform-skip / transquant-bypass
  blocks in mode 10 / 26 apply the implicit-RDPCM accumulation with
  mDir = predModeIntra / 26 (§8.4.4.1) when
  `implicit_rdpcm_enabled_flag` is set. Explicit-RDPCM blocks were
  previously rejected (`ReconError::RdpcmNotSupported`, now removed);
  implicit RDPCM silently decoded wrong. Also wires the §8.4.4.2.6
  `disableIntraBoundaryFilter` derivation
  (`intra_boundary_filtering_disabled_flag`, or implicit RDPCM with
  transquant bypass — angular 10/26 filters only; the §8.4.4.2.5 DC
  gate is the SCC flag alone). Validated by two self-built lossless
  conformance streams (`src/encoder/rdpcm_streams.rs`, pinned under
  `tests/fixture_bytes/`): the implicit-RDPCM stream is byte-exact
  against a black-box reference decode in both accumulation
  directions; the explicit-RDPCM stream decodes losslessly per the
  literal spec text (a documented reference deviation on
  vertical-direction blocks).

### Fixed — decode-conformance round 413 (2026-07-14)

- **§8.4.3 per-chroma-PB `IntraPredModeC` for `ChromaArrayType == 3`
  PART_NxN**: 4:4:4 intra NxN coding units signal four
  `intra_chroma_pred_mode` elements (§7.3.8.5) and each chroma
  prediction block derives its mode from its OWN co-located luma PB's
  `IntraPredModeY`; reconstruction applied the corner (blkIdx 0)
  derivation to all four chroma PBs. Exposed by a lossless 4:4:4
  black-box stream (new embedded pin in `tests/annexb_r413_axes.rs`);
  a ten-stream 4:4:4 / lossless / high-bit-depth sweep is byte-exact
  after the fix.

### Fixed — decode-conformance round 410 (2026-07-11)

Black-box whole-stream conformance sweep across encoder tool axes
(37 streams, all now byte-exact; nine new embedded pins in
`tests/annexb_tool_axes.rs`). Decoder fixes, all against the spec
text:

- **§8.5.3.2.9 collocated listCol selection**: for a bi-predicted
  collocated block, `NoBackwardPredFlag == 1` selects the collocated
  LX motion of the list being derived (the code always read L0), and
  otherwise listCol is LN with N being the VALUE of
  `collocated_from_l0_flag` (the selection was inverted). Broke
  temporal merge/AMVP candidates whenever a reference B picture
  served as the collocated picture (B pyramids, temporal layers,
  open-GOP, RADL streams).
- **§8.6.3 scaling lists were never applied**: the §7.3.4 parse
  existed but reconstruction always dequantized with the flat 16.
  ReconParams now carries the active ScalingFactor matrices (PPS
  body, else SPS body, else default lists) selected per Tables
  7-3/7-4 in both intra and inter paths, with the transform-skip
  `nTbS > 4` exception. Also fixes the inferred DC scaling factor of
  default / delta-0 lists (16, not 8 — §7.4.5).
- **§8.4.4.2.3 strong intra smoothing**: the eq 8-37/8-39 bilinear
  loops left reference index 62 unfilled (the spec range `0..62` is
  inclusive), corrupting smooth-gradient 32x32 intra blocks.
- **§7.3.8.10 deferred chroma in the inter path**: transform trees
  splitting to 4x4 luma leaves carry the parent's chroma on the
  `blkIdx == 3` child; the inter residual extraction wrote those
  blocks at the child's coordinates instead of the parent's
  (chroma shifted by two samples on rect/AMP + deep-RQT streams).
- **§8.4.4.2.1 constrained_intra_pred_flag** is now enforced:
  reference samples from non-intra coding units are unavailable for
  intra prediction in P/B pictures (previously parsed but ignored).
- **§7.3.8.11 transform_skip_flag** is now decoded (the leading
  residual_coding element desynchronized the CABAC walk on
  `transform_skip_enabled_flag` streams) and honoured end to end:
  Table 9-25 contexts, the explicit-RDPCM syntax pair (parsed;
  §8.6.8 reconstruction rejected explicitly as unimplemented), the
  signHidden suppression, the §9.3.4.2.5 sig-ctx gate, the §8.6.2
  tsShift path and the §8.6.3 flat-16 exception.
- **4:2:2 chroma halves**: a `log2TrafoSize == 3` split node's
  lower-half cbf flags now reach its 4x4 leaves (the recursion only
  passed the upper flags — CABAC desync), and the stacked
  upper/lower chroma residual blocks are paired to their coded
  halves instead of positionally (a lower-half-only residual was
  written into the upper half).

### Added — decode-conformance round 410

- Nine embedded tool-axis pins (B-pyramid TMVP, default scaling
  lists, strong intra smoothing, rect/AMP deferred chroma,
  constrained intra, transform skip, WPP+2-slices, open-GOP CRA with
  leading pictures, 4:2:2 10-bit I/P/B) with generation commands and
  SHA-256 sums in `tests/fixture_bytes/r410-generation-notes.md`.


### Added — clean-room rebuild round 396 (2026-07-07)

- **P-slice inter encoder** (`encoder::inter::encode_low_delay_p`):
  low-delay `IDR, P, P, …` GOPs. Every P frame is one TRAIL_R slice
  referencing the previous frame's reconstruction (inline §7.4.8
  short-term RPS, `delta_poc == −1`); per CTU skip / merge / AMVP
  compete under an SSD + λ·rate decision. Motion candidates are
  resolved through the DECODE-side §8.5.3.2 merge/AMVP derivation
  against the picture's in-progress motion field (with the §6.4.2
  availability process), motion estimation is a seeded greedy
  integer diamond plus half-/quarter-pel refinement against the
  crate's own §8.5.3.3.3 interpolation, and residuals go through the
  bin-exact §7.3.8.11 dual (§7.3.8.9 `mvd_coding` EG1 +
  `merge_idx` TR + `cu_skip_flag`/`pred_mode_flag`/`merge_flag`/
  `mvp_l0_flag`/`rqt_root_cbf` context coding). Pins: every frame of
  every GOP decodes bit-exactly to the encoder reconstruction
  across sizes/QPs; a static scene collapses to all-skip; cross-
  decoded byte-exact against a black-box reference decoder at QPs
  4/17/27/38/45 out of band. New `encode_low_delay_p` example.

- **Two active reference pictures** (POC − 1 and POC − 2, always on
  from the GOP's third frame): the slice header codes a two-entry
  §7.4.8 short-term RPS with the `num_ref_idx` override, the AMVP
  search runs per reference and signals `ref_idx_l0` (the
  single-bin TR at two actives), merge candidates carry the
  neighbours' reference identity through the motion field, and the
  SPS `sps_max_dec_pic_buffering_minus1` grows to 2 for GOP streams
  (standalone intra AUs keep 1 — their golden pin is unchanged).
  `FrameStats::ref1` counts CUs referencing POC − 2. Pins: flicker
  content elects the second reference (P and B) and decodes
  bit-exactly; the full 9-configuration cross-decode sweep stays
  byte-exact against the black-box reference decoder out of band;
  golden GOP pin regenerated (1011 bytes) and re-validated.

- **Rectangular inter partitions** (`PART_2NxN` / `PART_Nx2N`): every
  CTU decision now also competes two-PU splits — per-PU merge/AMVP
  election with the second PU resolved against the first PU's motion
  (the §8.5.3.2 order), the §7.4.9.8 `interSplitFlag` forced depth-1
  RQT (four 8x8 luma + 4x4 chroma TBs with §7.3.8.8 cbf
  inheritance), and the three-bin §9.3.3.7 inter `part_mode`
  binarization at MinCb. Decode-side fix: the §6.4.2 availability
  mask now reports the current (inter) CU as `MODE_INTER`, so a
  second partition's §8.5.3.2.7 AMVP neighbours correctly read the
  first partition (the pre-CU snapshot used to report the
  motion-field background there). `FrameStats::rect` counts the new
  shape. Pins: split-motion content elects rectangular CUs in both
  P and B modes and decodes bit-exactly; 12-configuration
  cross-decode sweep (rect / B / P / scene-change, QPs 4..45)
  byte-exact against the black-box reference decoder out of band;
  golden P-GOP pin regenerated and re-validated.

- **Low-delay B slices** (`LowDelayPEncoder::with_b_slices` /
  registry `bslices` option): non-IDR frames coded as B slices with
  both reference lists resolving to the previous picture (decode
  order == display order, SPS unchanged). Adds the B-side header
  (`slice_type == 0`, `mvd_l1_zero_flag`), initType-2 contexts, the
  §9.3.3.9 `inter_pred_idc` binarization on AMVP PUs, and the
  bi-predictive §8.5.3.2.2 merge candidates (zero-merge / combined
  candidates are bi on B slices — counted in `FrameStats::bi`).
  Pins: B GOPs decode bit-exactly at QPs 14/27/39 with bi-predicted
  CUs present; IDR-refreshing B GOPs roundtrip; registry B mode >
  34 dB; cross-decoded byte-exact against the black-box reference
  decoder (including a scene-change B GOP) out of band.

- **Streaming GOP encoder + registry `mode = "inter"`**:
  `encoder::inter::LowDelayPEncoder` encodes one frame per call
  (IDR at GOP starts — `gop == 0` for a single leading IDR — P
  slices in between), returning the access unit, keyframe flag,
  reconstruction and mode stats; `encode_low_delay_p` is now a thin
  wrapper. `make_encoder` grows `mode = "inter"` with `qp` / `gop`
  options and per-packet keyframe flags. Pins: registry
  encoder→decoder GOP roundtrip (gop 3: IDR/P/P/IDR/P with correct
  keyframe flags, > 34 dB per plane at qp 12); multi-GOP
  concatenated streams cross-decoded byte-exact against the
  black-box reference decoder out of band.

- P-slice **intra-CU fallback**: every CTU decision now also competes
  a `pred_mode_flag == 1` 2Nx2N intra candidate (all 35 §8.4 modes
  against the in-progress reconstruction, MPM signalling from the
  §8.4.2 candidate list with inter/skip neighbours contributing
  `INTRA_DC`, intra-stamped motion field exactly as the decoder
  does). `LowDelayPEncoded::stats` exposes per-frame
  skip/merge/AMVP/intra counters. Pins: a hard mid-GOP scene change
  elects intra for most CTBs while steady frames stay
  inter-dominated, bit-exact through our decoder and byte-exact
  through the black-box reference decoder at QPs 12/27/40.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 391 (2026-07-06)

- **Real CABAC intra encoder** (`encoder::intra`), replacing the
  PCM-only bootstrap as the compression path: per-CTU §8.4 intra
  prediction over the encoder's own reconstruction (all 35 modes
  through the decode-side §8.4.4.2 pipeline, SAD mode decision),
  forward DCT-II (the §8.6.4.2 basis transposed) + reciprocal
  quantization at any SliceQpY 0..=51 (chroma via the Table 8-10
  mapping), decode-side §8.6.2 reconstruction (so the reference
  buffer is bit-identical to any conforming decoder), and full
  §7.3.8.5 syntax emission (`part_mode`, §8.4.2 MPM candidate list
  with `prev_intra_luma_pred_flag` / `mpm_idx` /
  `rem_intra_luma_pred_mode`, `intra_chroma_pred_mode`, cbf flags,
  residual blocks). Pins: decoder output == encoder reconstruction
  EXACTLY at QPs 4/22/32/45 across three geometries; a golden
  interop stream (validated bit-exact against a black-box reference
  decoder out of band) is CI-gated; PSNR/size track QP. New
  `encode_intra` example.

- Intra encoder **PART_NxN**: each CTB now rate-distortion-competes
  `PART_2Nx2N` against four independently-moded 8x8 luma PBs (§7.4.9.8
  `IntraSplitFlag` forcing the transform tree to depth 1: four 8x8
  luma + four 4x4 chroma TBs with their §7.4.9.11 mode-dependent
  scans), with the §7.3.8.5 two-loop luma-mode group, per-PB §8.4.2
  MPM chains inside the CTB, §7.3.8.8 cbf inheritance from the root
  chroma flags, and true §6.4.1 z-scan reference availability
  (quadrant order within the CTB). NxN streams decode bit-exact
  through the crate's decoder and a black-box reference decoder;
  golden interop pin regenerated and re-validated.

- Registry encoder (`make_encoder` / `H265Encoder`, formerly
  `H265PcmEncoder`) gains the `mode` codec option: `"pcm"` (default,
  bit-exact lossless bootstrap) or `"intra"` (the real CABAC intra
  coder) with a `qp` option (`SliceQpY` 0..=51, default 26). Malformed
  options are rejected at construction.

- **§7.3.8.11 `residual_coding( )` encoder**
  (`encoder::residual::encode_residual_coding`) — the bin-exact dual
  of the decoder: every element from
  `last_sig_coeff_{x,y}_{prefix,suffix}` (eqs. 7-74..7-77 inverted)
  through `coeff_abs_level_remaining` (§9.3.3.11 TR/EGk dual with
  eq. 9-24 Rice adaptation), emitted with the same §9.3.4.2 ctxInc
  helpers the decode side uses. Differential tests across
  log2TrafoSize 2..=5, all scans, luma+chroma, Rice escapes to
  CoeffMax, and the §7.4.9.11 DC-inference sub-block: identical
  levels AND identical context-state evolution.

- **Multi-tile slice segments** end to end. Decoder: the §7.3.8.1
  subset walk now fires on tile boundaries, not just WPP rows —
  `end_of_subset_one_bit` + byte alignment when the next CTB (in tile
  scan) starts a new tile, §9.3.2.2 context re-initialization at each
  tile's first CTU (taking priority over the §9.3.2.5 WPP sync, whose
  row-start / storage conditions are now the exact tile-relative
  §9.3.1 forms), and the §8.6.1 `qPY_PREV` reset at the first
  quantization group of a tile (and of each CTB row of a tile under
  WPP). Encoder: `PcmAuOptions::tiles` codes the picture as ONE slice
  segment over a uniform tile grid — §6.5.1 tile-scan CTB order,
  per-tile CABAC engine + context resets, and the §7.4.7.1
  `entry_point_offset_minus1[]` block with offsets in coded bytes
  (emulation-prevention-aware, zero-run threaded across subsets).
  Grids 2x2 / 3x2 / 2x1 / 5x5 roundtrip bit-exact through the crate's
  decoder and decode losslessly through a black-box reference decoder.
  New `encode_pcm` example drives the encoder from raw YUV.

- CI-gated the **true-tiles fixture** (`true-tiles-2x2`): a genuine
  `tiles_enabled_flag == 1` bitstream (2×2 uniform tile grid, one
  64×64 CTB per tile, one independent slice segment per tile,
  `loop_filter_across_tiles_enabled_flag == 0`) decodes byte-exact on
  both its IDR and P frames through the §6.5.1 tile scan
  (`CtbAddrRsToTs` slice-address mapping), the §6.4.1 tile-boundary
  availability denial, and the §8.7.2.1 / §8.7.3.2 loop-filter
  suppression across tile edges.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 387 (2026-07-03)

- `hvcc` (new module) — `HEVCDecoderConfigurationRecord` parse
  (ISO/IEC 14496-15 §8.3.3.1: fixed prefix, profile/tier/level
  mirrors, `lengthSizeMinusOne`, parameter-set NAL arrays with the
  reserved-type-skip tolerance) plus length-prefixed sample-data
  re-framing. The registry decoder accepts both extradata forms; an
  `hvcC` extradata switches packets to `lengthSizeMinusOne + 1`-byte
  big-endian NAL framing. Pinned byte-exact with the corpus'
  `iso-mp4-vs-annexb-pair` MP4 form.

- §8.5.3.3.4.3 **explicit weighted sample prediction** end to end:
  `explicit_weighted_pred` (equations 8-265..8-277),
  `predict_inter_pu_weighted` / `reconstruct_inter_pu_weighted`
  dispatch, and the §7.4.7.3 slice-table resolution
  (`SliceWpTables`: weight-flag inference, equation-7-58
  `ChromaOffsetLX`, `WpOffsetBdShiftY/C` scaling). Two self-built
  fade fixtures pin the P (uni) and B (uni + bi) explicit paths
  byte-exact.

- Fixed §8.5.3.2.3 spatial-merge redundancy gates: the B0 / A0 / B2
  "same motion" comparisons are gated on the earlier position's *raw*
  `availableN`, not its post-redundancy `availableFlagN` — a B1
  pruned as a duplicate of A1 still prunes an identical B0 (the
  phantom candidate shifted the temporal candidate down the list).

- `encoder` (new module tree) — the write side: `BitWriter` (`u(n)`,
  `ue(v)` / `se(v)`, `rbsp_trailing_bits()`), NAL encapsulation
  (§7.4.1.1 emulation-prevention insertion + Annex B framing), and
  the §9.3.5 CABAC arithmetic *encoding* engine (InitEncoder /
  EncodeDecision / EncodeBypass / EncodeTerminate with the
  Figure 9-11/9-12 renormalization + PutBit carry control), all
  pinned by bit-exact roundtrips through the crate's own decoders.

- §7.3.8.7 **PCM samples** end to end: parse (`pcm_alignment_zero_bit`
  run, `u(v)` rasters at `PcmBitDepthY/C`, §9.3.1 / §9.3.2.6 engine
  re-init), §8.4.1 equation-8-12 reconstruction, and the §8.7.2.5.4 /
  §8.7.3.1 loop-filter suppression of PCM
  (`pcm_loop_filter_disabled_flag`) and transquant-bypass coding
  units (`NoFilterMap` threaded through deblocking and SAO).

- **PCM-only IDR encoder** (`encoder::pcm` + registry
  `make_encoder` / `H265PcmEncoder`): fully conformant Main-profile
  Annex B IDR access units (real VPS / SPS / PPS / slice headers /
  §7.3.8 slice data through the §9.3.5 engine) in which every CTB is
  a 16×16 PCM coding unit — bit-exact lossless, one keyframe packet
  per frame. Options cover dependent slice segments, independent
  multi-slice plans with per-slice loop-filter flags, deblocking, and
  band / edge SAO syntax. A black-box reference decoder reproduces
  the exact input from every encoded shape.

- **Dependent slice segments** decode: §7.4.7.1 header + `SliceAddrRs`
  inheritance from the preceding independent segment and the
  §9.3.2.4 / §9.3.2.5 `TableStateIdxDs` context carry across segment
  boundaries. Slice-header fix: the entry-point and header-extension
  blocks sit outside the `!dependent` gate and are now parsed for
  dependent segments too.

- **Per-slice** `slice_loop_filter_across_slices_enabled_flag`:
  deblocking consults the flag of the slice containing the current
  coding block (per-CTB map); the §8.7.3.2 SAO cross-slice neighbour
  rule is directional on the later (decode-order) slice's flag.
  Pinned with a self-built two-AU fixture with opposite per-slice
  flags. (Known corner: a black-box reference decoder disagrees with
  the §8.7.3.2 text on which slice's flag gates the SAO read; this
  implementation follows the spec text of both the 08/2021 and
  01/2026 editions.)

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 384 (2026-07-03)

- `sequence` (new module) — the whole-bitstream Annex B decode driver:
  NAL demux → parameter-set activation → §7.3.6.1 slice headers → the
  §7.3.8.1 CTU CABAC loop (tile-scan addressing, per-slice init, WPP
  entry-point substreams with the §7.4.1.1 coded-byte → RBSP boundary
  mapping, `end_of_subset_one_bit`, the §9.3.2.4 / §9.3.2.5 context
  storage / synchronization) → picture reconstruction → the
  §8.3.1..§8.3.5 reference cycle → output-order frames.
  `decode_annexb_sequence` (one-shot) and `SequenceDecoder`
  (streaming: `push_nal_unit` / `flush` / `take_decoded`). Every
  Annex B bitstream in the staged 16-fixture corpus decodes
  byte-exact, including Main10 / 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 10-bit, the
  eight-picture B pyramid, four-slice pictures, and WPP.

- `decoder` (new module) — the `oxideav_core::Decoder` registry entry:
  Annex B packets in, output-order `VideoFrame`s out with a
  `sps_max_num_reorder_pics`-deep reorder queue, packet-PTS
  re-attachment, Annex B extradata, and flush-then-`Eof` semantics.
  `register()` is live (ids `h265` / `hevc`; `hvc1` / `hev1` / `HEVC`
  FourCCs, MP4 OTI, Matroska tag); `make_decoder` is the direct
  factory endpoint.

- `slice_data::PictureParseState` — picture-level parse state: the
  §8.4.2 intra-mode field derived DURING the CABAC walk (the
  §7.4.9.11 mode-dependent residual scans need real
  `IntraPredModeY`/`C` values), plus picture-level `CtDepth` /
  `cu_skip_flag` grids with §6.4.1 slice / tile availability so the
  §9.3.4.2.2 ctxInc neighbour reads cross CTU boundaries (the
  per-CTU `CtuGrid` is gone).

- §8.6.1 quantization-parameter derivation in `ReconCtx`: per-4×4
  `QpY` map, decode-order `qPY_PREV` threading with slice / WPP-row
  resets, `qPY_A` / `qPY_B` same-CTB-gated neighbour reads, and
  §7.4.9.14 `CuQpDeltaVal` scoping from the delta-carrying CU to the
  end of its quantization group. Deblocking reads per-position
  `QpQ` / `QpP` from the map.

- §7.3.8.10 deferred-chroma reconstruction (an 8×8 luma node with 4×4
  children carries its chroma on `blkIdx == 3` covering the node) and
  cbf-clear chroma intra prediction; `ChromaArrayType == 2` stacks the
  two square blocks vertically.

- §8.7.2.1 / §8.7.3.2 loop-filter boundary gating: deblocking
  `filterLeft/TopCbEdgeFlag` and the SAO edge-offset neighbour test
  honour slice / tile boundaries when filtering across them is
  disabled.

- `Picture::to_planar_le16` for the >8-bit planar fixture layout.

### Fixed — clean-room rebuild round 384

- §7.3.6.1: `slice_temporal_mvp_enabled_flag` was read outside the
  non-IDR block (one spurious bit on every IDR slice under a
  temporal-MVP SPS), and the SAO flag pair was read for dependent
  slice segments; both gates now match the syntax table.
- §9.3.4.2.5 eq. 9-42: the DC coefficient's sigCtx is 0 — the
  eqs. 9-49..9-53 size/colour/scan modifications belong to the fourth
  branch only (ctxInc 0 luma / 27 chroma for every `log2TrafoSize > 2`
  DC position).
- §8.6.4.2 eq. 8-316: the printed DST-VII matrix follows the eq. 8-318
  `[column][row]` convention — the multiplication reads the printed
  rows transposed, matching the in-code DCT read (verified against
  the conformance output of the qp-high fixture's first 4×4 block).
- §7.3.8.11: both `last_sig_coeff_{x,y}_prefix` bins precede the two
  bypass suffixes; the interleave desynchronized any TB whose last
  coordinate exceeds 3.
- §7.3.8.9: `mvd_coding()` reads both components'
  `abs_mvd_greater0_flag` bins first, then both greater1 bins, then
  the per-component suffix/sign blocks (`decode_mvd_pair`).
- §7.3.2.3.3: SCC PPS ACT-offset range checks run in i64 (fuzz-found
  subtract-overflow on se(v) extremes); palette-predictor initializer
  counts and entry bit depths are §7.4.3.3.3-bounded before
  allocation / width arithmetic.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 372 (2026-06-26)

- `poc` (new module) §8.3.1 picture-order-count derivation: `PocState`
  threads `prevTid0Pic`'s `(slice_pic_order_cnt_lsb, PicOrderCntMsb)`
  across the picture sequence and `PocState::decode_picture_poc` derives
  each picture's `PicOrderCntVal = PicOrderCntMsb + slice_pic_order_cnt_lsb`
  (equations 8-1 / 8-2), resetting the MSB for an IRAP with
  `NoRaslOutputFlag == 1` and skipping the `prevTid0Pic` update for
  RASL / RADL / SLNR / `TemporalId != 0` pictures. `NalKind` classifies
  a `nal_unit_type` into the Table 7-1 IRAP / IDR / BLA / CRA / RASL /
  RADL / SLNR categories the §8.3.x processes branch on, and
  `diff_pic_order_cnt` implements equation 8-4.

- `dpb` (new module) — the decoded-picture buffer plus §8.3.2 reference-
  picture-set marking, §8.3.4 reference-picture-list construction, and
  §8.3.5 collocated-picture selection. `Dpb` stores each `DpbEntry`
  (reconstructed `Picture`, `PicOrderCntVal`, `Marking`, per-PU
  `MotionField`). `build_rps_poc_lists` builds the five §8.3.2 POC lists
  (equation 8-5, the IDR short-circuit + long-term MSB-cycle resolution);
  `Dpb::apply_rps` resolves them against the DPB and applies the four-step
  §8.3.2 marking (IRAP-no-RASL unmark, long-term LSB/full-POC lookup,
  short-term exact-POC lookup, "unused for reference" sweep);
  `Dpb::build_ref_pic_lists` constructs `RefPicList0` / `RefPicList1`
  (equations 8-8..8-11, including the `RefPicListTemp1` before/after swap
  and the `list_entry_lX` modification) via `RefPicListParams`;
  `select_col_pic` (§8.3.5) picks `ColPic` and `no_backward_pred_flag`
  derives `NoBackwardPredFlag`.

- `motion` §8.5.3.2.8 / §8.5.3.2.9 temporal (collocated) luma
  motion-vector prediction: `derive_temporal_mv` runs the
  bottom-right-then-center §8.5.3.2.8 location search (the equation-8-198
  / 8-199 `(xPb+nPbW, yPb+nPbH)` bottom-right candidate gated on the
  same-CTB-row / in-picture test and snapped to the 16×16 grid, falling
  back to the equation-8-200 / 8-201 center) reading the collocated
  picture's `MotionField`. The §8.5.3.2.9 `collocated_mv` selects
  `mvCol` / `listCol` from the col cell's `predFlagL0Col` / `predFlagL1Col`
  + `NoBackwardPredFlag` / `collocated_from_l0_flag`, applies the
  long-term-status equality gate, and either copies (equation 8-204) or
  scales (equations 8-205..8-209, via the `td=colPocDiff` / `tb=currPocDiff`
  distances) `mvLXCol`. `TemporalMvContext` carries the geometry + POC +
  long-term inputs.

- `recon` multi-slice picture assembly: `ReconCtx` now carries a per-CTB
  `SliceAddrRs` map (`ReconCtx::set_slice_addr_rs`) and the §6.4.1 z-scan
  availability consults it (replacing the previous constant-`0`
  single-slice assumption), so a neighbour in a different slice segment is
  denied for both the §8.4.2 most-probable-mode derivation and the
  §8.4.4.2.1 reference-sample gathering. `PlacedCtu` gains a
  `slice_addr_rs` field and `reconstruct_intra_picture` builds the map
  from the placed CTUs and threads it through, also gating the §7.4.9.3
  SAO merge-left / merge-up candidates on the same-slice test.

- `recon::build_slice_addr_map` (§7.4.7.1) — builds the per-CTB
  `SliceAddrRs[ ctbAddrRs ]` map for a picture from its ordered
  `SliceSegmentBoundary` list (`slice_segment_address` +
  `dependent_slice_segment_flag`). An independent segment sets
  `SliceAddrRs = slice_segment_address`; a dependent segment inherits the
  active independent segment's `SliceAddrRs`; CTBs are partitioned in
  tile-scan order via the `PictureTiling` address maps. Validated against
  the `multi-slice-per-frame` fixture geometry (4×4 CTB grid, four
  row-wise slices at addresses 0 / 4 / 8 / 12).

- `decode` (new module) — the picture-sequence decode state machine.
  `PictureSequenceState` threads the cross-picture `PocState`
  (`prevTid0Pic`) + `Dpb` across a coded video sequence;
  `begin_picture(header, slice)` runs the per-picture §8.3.1 → §8.3.2 →
  §8.3.4 → §8.3.5 chain (POC derivation, RPS list build + DPB marking,
  `RefPicList0` / `RefPicList1` construction for P / B slices, and `ColPic`
  + `NoBackwardPredFlag` selection for temporal MV), returning a
  `PictureRefState`; `store_picture` inserts the reconstructed picture +
  its per-PU `MotionField` into the DPB as a short-term reference. Tests
  cover the IDR→P RefPicList resolution, temporal-MVP ColPic selection,
  and second-IDR reference unmarking.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 369 (2026-06-25)

- `sps` §7.3.2.2.2 `sps_range_extension()` — the nine RExt flags
  (`transform_skip_rotation_enabled_flag` … `cabac_bypass_alignment_enabled_flag`)
  are decoded in place into `SpsRangeExtension` rather than left opaque,
  surfaced on `SeqParameterSet::sps_range_extension`.

- `pps` §7.3.2.3.2 `pps_range_extension()` — the RExt PPS body
  (`log2_max_transform_skip_block_size_minus2`, the cross-component and
  chroma-QP-offset-list controls, and the
  `log2_sao_offset_scale_{luma,chroma}` fields) is decoded into the PPS.

- `sps` §7.3.2.2.3 `sps_scc_extension()` — the Screen Content Coding SPS
  body is decoded in place into the new `SpsSccExtension`
  (`sps_curr_pic_ref_enabled_flag`, `palette_mode_enabled_flag` with the
  `palette_max_size` / `delta_palette_max_predictor_size` /
  per-component `sps_palette_predictor_initializer[comp][i]` table sized
  `u(v)` by `BitDepthY` / `BitDepthC`, `motion_vector_resolution_control_idc`,
  `intra_boundary_filtering_disabled_flag`), surfaced on
  `SeqParameterSet::sps_scc_extension`. Per the §7.3.2.2.1 body order
  (range, multilayer, 3D, scc) the SCC body is decoded only when no
  still-opaque multilayer / 3D body precedes it; otherwise the whole
  span stays in the opaque tail. Four new unit tests cover the
  range-then-SCC, SCC-only, palette-initializer, and
  SCC-behind-multilayer paths.

- `pps` §7.3.2.3.3 `pps_scc_extension()` — the Screen Content Coding PPS
  body is decoded in place into the new `PpsSccExtension`
  (`pps_curr_pic_ref_enabled_flag`,
  `residual_adaptive_colour_transform_enabled_flag` with the
  `pps_slice_act_qp_offsets_present_flag` /
  `pps_act_{y,cb,cr}_qp_offset_*` se(v) offsets, and the picture
  palette-predictor initializers — `monochrome_palette_flag`,
  `luma_bit_depth_entry_minus8` / `chroma_bit_depth_entry_minus8`, and
  the per-component `pps_palette_predictor_initializer[comp][i]` table
  sized `u(v)` from this body's own entry bit-depths). Surfaced on
  `PicParameterSet::pps_scc_extension`, decoded only when no opaque
  multilayer / 3D body precedes it (§7.3.2.3.1 body order). Five new
  unit tests cover the minimal, ACT-offset, palette-initializer,
  range-then-SCC, and SCC-behind-multilayer paths.

- `sps` / `pps` SCC §7.4.3.2.3 / §7.4.3.3.3 conformance checks +
  derived-value accessors — the SPS SCC parse now rejects the reserved
  `motion_vector_resolution_control_idc == 3` and the
  `palette_max_size == 0` violations (a non-zero
  `delta_palette_max_predictor_size` or a set
  `sps_palette_predictor_initializers_present_flag`); the PPS SCC parse
  rejects `PpsActQpOffset{Y,Cb,Cr}` outside −12..=12. New accessors
  expose the spec equations: `SpsSccExtension::palette_max_predictor_size`
  (eq. 7-35) and `PpsSccExtension::pps_act_qp_offset_{y,cb,cr}`
  (eq. 7-39/40/41). Three new rejection tests plus accessor assertions.

- `slice` §7.3.6.1 SCC / RExt slice-header QP-offset fields — now that
  the PPS surfaces the SCC and range-extension bodies, the slice header
  decodes the `slice_act_{y,cb,cr}_qp_offset` se(v) fields (present when
  `pps_slice_act_qp_offsets_present_flag`, with the §7.4.7.1 sum bound
  `PpsActQpOffset* + slice_act_*` enforced to −12..=12) and the
  `cu_chroma_qp_offset_enabled_flag` u(1) (present when the
  range-extension `chroma_qp_offset_list_enabled_flag` is set), instead
  of leaving them unparsed. Three new slice-header tests cover the ACT
  offsets, the `cu_chroma_qp_offset_enabled_flag` gate, and the
  out-of-range ACT-sum rejection.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 364 (2026-06-24)

- `motion` §8.5.3.2.3 spatial merging candidates — `NeighbourPu` snapshots
  the `(MvLX, RefIdxLX, PredFlagLX)` motion of a neighbour PU;
  `SpatialMergeNeighbours` carries the five §6.4.2-gated neighbour
  positions (A1, B1, B0, A0, B2); `derive_spatial_merge_candidates`
  implements the eq 8-128..8-142 derivation with the full redundancy
  pruning (B1≠A1, B0≠B1, A0≠A1, B2≠A1/B1, B2 dropped when four already
  available), the `PartitionContext` A1/B1 exclusion for the second
  partition of vertical/horizontal-split `PartMode`s, and the
  `Log2ParMrgLevel` same-region forcing. Output `SpatialMergeCandidates`
  appends in the eq 8-119 order.

- `motion` §8.5.3.2.4 combined bi-predictive candidates —
  `append_combined_bi_candidates` pairs each new candidate's L0 motion and
  L1 motion from existing candidates per Table 8-7, gated on the eq 8-143
  `DiffPicOrderCnt(...) != 0 || mvL0 != mvL1` distinctness test (B slices,
  `2 <= numOrig < MaxNumMergeCand`), stopping at
  `combIdx == numOrig*(numOrig−1)` or a full list.

- `motion` §8.5.3.2.2 merge-list driver — `build_merge_candidate`
  assembles the full `mergeCandList` (steps 5–8: spatial, then temporal
  `Col`, then combined bi-pred, then zero-MV padding to `MaxNumMergeCand`)
  and selects `mergeCandList[ merge_idx ]` (step 9) with the step-10
  `(nOrigPbW + nOrigPbH == 12)` bi→uni-L0 reduction. `MergeListParams`
  carries the per-slice inputs. 12 new unit tests cover pruning, partition
  exclusion, same-region forcing, Table 8-7 pairing, the degenerate
  skip, index selection into the zero padding, and the 8x4/4x8 step-10
  reduction. The temporal `Col` candidate is supplied by the caller
  (`None` until the §8.5.3.2.8 collocated-picture path lands).

- `motion` §8.5.3.2.6 / §8.5.3.2.7 luma motion-vector prediction —
  `derive_mvp_candidate` builds the `mvpListLX` (eq 8-170: A, then B when
  `mvLXA != mvLXB`, then the temporal `Col`, then zero padding to two
  entries) and selects `mvpListLX[ mvp_lX_flag ]`. The §8.5.3.2.7 A
  derivation runs its two passes (eqs 8-171/8-172 same-POC, then
  8-173..8-183 long-term-matched + scaling) over A0/A1; the B derivation
  runs the same-POC pass (eqs 8-184/8-185), the `isScaledFlag == 0`
  step-4 B→A promotion (eq 8-186), and the step-5 long-term/scaling
  re-derivation over B0/B1/B2 (eqs 8-187..8-197). `scale_temporal_mv`
  implements the eq 8-179..8-183 / 8-193..8-197 distance scaling.
  `RefPicId` + `MvpContext` carry the per-list reference picture and the
  POC / long-term / short-term resolvers the picture driver supplies. 8
  new unit tests cover zero padding, same-POC pick, B→A promotion, Col
  insertion / suppression, and the short-term scaling arithmetic. The
  §8.5.3.2.8 temporal predictor `mvLXCol` is passed in (`None` until the
  collocated path lands).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 360 (2026-06-22)

- `intra_mode_field` §8.4.2 most-probable-mode neighbour state — the new
  `IntraModeField` records each decoded luma prediction block's
  `IntraPredModeY` / `CuPredMode` / `pcm_flag` on the 4×4 luma min-block
  grid and implements the §8.4.2 step-1/step-2 `candIntraPredModeX`
  derivation: out-of-picture / `available == FALSE` / non-`MODE_INTRA` /
  `pcm_flag` / above-CTB-row neighbours all map to `INTRA_DC`, otherwise the
  recorded neighbour mode. 9 unit tests cover every branch.

- `recon` §8.4.2 neighbour-aware intra driver — a per-picture `ReconCtx`
  (the `IntraModeField` + the §6.4.1 `PictureTiling`) is shared across CTUs.
  `reconstruct_cu` now derives each luma PB's `IntraPredModeY` from the
  actual left/above neighbours (most-probable-mode) and records it back,
  for both `PART_2Nx2N` (one PB) and `PART_NxN` (four PBs mapped onto the
  four top-level transform-tree children), replacing the flat-single-CU
  `INTRA_DC` hardcode. `gather_reference_samples` switches to the true
  §6.4.1 z-scan availability (mapping chroma plane coords to luma) instead
  of the raster approximation. `reconstruct_intra_ctu_ctx` is the new
  shared-ctx entry; the single-CTU `reconstruct_intra_ctu` keeps its
  signature. Adds `ReconError::Tiling`. Two tests prove a right CU's
  `mpm_idx == 0` inherits the left neighbour's angular mode through
  `candModeList[0]`, whereas an isolated CU derives `INTRA_PLANAR`.

- `recon` picture-level intra driver — `reconstruct_intra_picture` allocates
  the `Picture`, reconstructs each `PlacedCtu` through the shared
  `ReconCtx`, resolves each CTB's §7.4.9.3 `ResolvedSao` with left/above
  merge, then runs the §8.7.3 `apply_sao_picture` in-loop SAO pass.
  `IntraPictureParams` carries the CTB/min-TB log2 sizes, tile layout,
  slice SAO flags, and SAO offset scales. The real `tiny-i` IDR fixture now
  decodes byte-exact to `expected.yuv` through the full recon + SAO path (a
  new integration test), and a unit test confirms a band-offset CTB shifts
  samples by the resolved offset.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 356 (2026-06-21)

- `deblock` §8.7.2.1 picture-level deblocking driver — `deblock_picture`
  ties the round's pieces into the whole-picture process: it filters all
  vertical edges first, then all horizontal edges (on the
  vertically-filtered samples), walking a `&[DeblockCuDesc]` in coding
  order. Each CU contributes its `TransformSplit` + `PartMode` +
  `filter_left`/`filter_top` boundary flags; per CU per pass the driver
  derives the §8.7.2.2/.3 edge flags, the §8.7.2.4 bS from the
  `MotionField`, and applies `filter_cu_edges`. The caller owns the
  §8.7.2.1 boundary exclusions (picture/tile/slice edges + the
  `slice_deblocking_filter_disabled_flag` skip). 3 new tests: a two-CU
  vertical-seam smooth (luma + 8-aligned 4:2:0 chroma), a single-CU
  no-internal-edge byte-identical no-op, and a one-level-split cross-seam
  smoothed in both passes.

- `deblock` §8.7.2.5.1 / §8.7.2.5.2 CU-level edge-filtering driver —
  `filter_cu_edges` filters every edge of one coding unit in one direction
  directly into a `Picture` (luma + Cb + Cr planes):
  - Luma: the §8.7.2.5.4 block-edge filter at every `bS > 0` sampled
    position (8-stride along the edge axis, 4-stride across).
  - Chroma (`ChromaArrayType != 0`): the §8.7.2.5.5 filter at every
    `bS == 2` position whose chroma edge is on the 8-chroma-sample grid,
    stepping `8 / SubWidthC` (EDGE_VER) / `8 / SubHeightC` (EDGE_HOR) in
    the edge axis, for both Cb and Cr with their `pps_c*_qp_offset`.
  - `DeblockCu` (CU geometry + neighbour p-side `QpY`) + `DeblockCuParams`
    (QpY, slice β/tC offsets, chroma QP offsets, bit depths,
    ChromaArrayType) carry the per-CU context; `Picture::plane_mut`
    exposes a mutable component plane for in-place filtering.
  6 new tests: vertical/horizontal internal luma seam smoothing,
  4:2:0 chroma skipping a non-8-aligned internal edge vs. filtering an
  8-aligned CU-boundary edge, bS=1 luma-only (chroma skipped), and
  monochrome luma-only.

- `deblock` §8.7.2.2 / §8.7.2.3 edge-flag derivation — the missing input
  to the §8.7.2.4 bS stage, produced from the coding block's geometry:
  - `TransformSplit`: the transform-tree split geometry of a coding
    block (`Split` quadrants / `Leaf` transform blocks), with `leaf()` /
    `split_once()` constructors.
  - `transform_block_boundary` (§8.7.2.2): the recursive descent that
    marks each transform-block leading edge into the `edge_flags` +
    `tb_edge` grids, gating the coding-block boundary (xB0/yB0 == 0) by
    `filterEdgeFlag` and marking interior transform splits unconditionally.
  - `prediction_block_boundary` (§8.7.2.3): the `PartMode` internal
    prediction partition column/row (PART_Nx2N/NxN at nCbS/2, AMP
    PART_nLx2N/nRx2N at nCbS/4 · {1,3}, PART_2NxN/2NxnU/2NxnD likewise),
    set in `edge_flags` only (a prediction edge is not a TB edge).
  - `derive_edge_flags` → `EdgeFlags`: the public entry that runs both
    derivations for one CB + edge direction and exposes the
    `edge_flags()` / `tb_edge()` grids that feed `derive_boundary_strength`.
  9 new tests: single-TB left boundary + gating, one-level + nested
  transform splits (EDGE_VER / EDGE_HOR), PART_Nx2N prediction edge (not
  a TB edge), AMP columns/rows, and an end-to-end edge-flags → bS=2 check.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 350 (2026-06-20)

- `deblock` module — the §8.7.2.5 deblocking edge-filtering process, the
  sample-modification stage that the §8.7.2.4 bS derivation fed into:
  - `beta_prime` / `tc_prime`: Table 8-12 β′/tC′ from input Q.
  - `luma_beta_tc`: §8.7.2.5.3 β/tC derivation (eqs. 8-347..8-351).
  - `luma_sample_decision` (§8.7.2.5.6) + `luma_edge_decision`
    (§8.7.2.5.3 dE/dEp/dEq over the 4-row segment).
  - `filter_luma_sample`: §8.7.2.5.7 strong (eqs. 8-389..8-394) and weak
    (eqs. 8-395..8-402) luma sample filters with ±2·tC clipping.
  - `chroma_qpc_420` (Table 8-10), `chroma_tc` (§8.7.2.5.5) and
    `filter_chroma_sample` (§8.7.2.5.8) for the chroma path.
  - `SamplePlane` + `filter_luma_block_edge` (§8.7.2.5.4) /
    `filter_chroma_block_edge` (§8.7.2.5.5): plane-level drivers that
    gather and apply the primitives in place across a 4-row EDGE_VER /
    EDGE_HOR segment.
  16 new deblock unit/integration tests (Table 8-12 / 8-10 breakpoints,
  β/tC at 8/10-bit, flat/step decision paths, strong/weak/chroma filter
  math, plane-level seam smoothing).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 341 (2026-06-19)

- `picture` module — the §8 reconstruction target: a `Picture` holding
  the three reconstructed sample planes (`SL` / `SCb` / `SCr`) sized from
  the active geometry + `ChromaArrayType` (Table 6-1 `SubWidthC` /
  `SubHeightC`), per-sample read/write, the §8 `Clip1Y` / `Clip1C`
  sample clip (`clip1`), and an 8-bit planar `Y`→`Cb`→`Cr` packer for
  fixture comparison.
- `recon` module — the §8.4 intra sample-reconstruction driver, the rung
  between the §7.3.8 slice-data syntax walk and the per-block §8.4.4
  intra-prediction + §8.6 dequantization / inverse-transform primitives.
  `reconstruct_intra_ctu` walks a decoded `CodingTreeUnit` and writes
  reconstructed samples into a `Picture`:
  - §8.4.2 `IntraPredModeY` + §8.4.3 `IntraPredModeC` derivation from the
    signalled luma/chroma mode fields.
  - §8.4.4.2.1 reference-sample gathering from the already-reconstructed
    picture (the §6.4.1 raster within-picture availability), then
    §8.4.4.2 prediction.
  - §8.6.2 dequantize + inverse-transform of each coded residual block,
    §8.4.4.1 add-and-clip into the plane.
  - §8.6.1 `Qp′Y` (eq. 8-258) and `Qp′Cb` / `Qp′Cr` (Table 8-10 4:2:0
    chroma-QP mapping, eq. 8-260) derivation.
  - The transform-tree recursion reconstructs each leaf transform block
    luma + (4:2:0 / 4:2:2 / 4:4:4) chroma in §8.4.4.1 decode order.
  - 6 driver unit tests plus an end-to-end fixture test
    (`tiny_i_reconstructs_expected_yuv_end_to_end`) that decodes the real
    `tiny-i-only-16x16-main` IDR slice CABAC bytes through the §7.3.8
    syntax walk and reconstructs the byte-exact `expected.yuv` planes
    (luma 0x51, Cb 0x5a, Cr 0xf0), with the single-CTU slice terminating
    at `end_of_slice_segment_flag`. This is the crate's first
    decode-to-pixels validation on a real bitstream.

### Fixed — round 341

- §9.3.3.3 EGk prefix polarity (two call sites). The k-th-order
  Exp-Golomb prefix decode — both the `coeff_abs_level_remaining`
  escape-path suffix and the shared `read_eg_k_with` helper used by
  `cu_qp_delta_abs`, `palette_escape_val`, and the `abs_mvd_minus2` EG1
  escape — counted leading `0` bins terminated by a `1`, but per
  eq. 9-13 the EGk unary prefix is a run of `1` bins terminated by a
  single `0` (the §9.3.3.3 NOTE: EGk uses 1's and 0's reversed from the
  §9.2 EG0 prefix). The inverted polarity produced wrong escape-path
  magnitudes for every EGk-coded syntax element, mis-decoding
  `cu_qp_delta_abs` and the high-magnitude coefficient levels and
  derailing the residual-coding CABAC alignment. With the fix the
  `tiny-i-only-16x16-main` slice decodes bit-exactly to its
  `end_of_slice_segment_flag` terminator and reconstructs the documented
  `expected.yuv`. Seven unit tests that had encoded the inverted
  zeros-then-one prefix are rewritten to the spec-correct ones-then-zero
  shape.
- §8.6.4 inverse-transform matrix orientation. The §8.6.4.2 1-D transform
  read the in-code DCT base table as `transMatrix[i][j*stride]`, but per
  eqs. 8-318/8-319 the named `transMatrixCol0to15` base table is indexed
  `[column][row]`, so the in-code row-major listing is the transpose of
  `transMatrix` and eq. 8-317 must read it as `DCT32[j*stride][i]`. The
  previous indexing computed the forward (analysis) transform — a DC-only
  coefficient excited a non-constant column instead of the flat row-0 DC
  basis, so a DC-only block reconstructed to a spread of values rather
  than the uniform field the inverse transform must produce. Two unit
  tests that had baked in the transposed behaviour are rewritten to the
  correct constant-field reconstruction.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 338 (2026-06-19)

- `slice_data` module — the §7.3.8.1 .. §7.3.8.6 slice-data CABAC
  syntax-element walk, the upper rung of the §7.3.8 parse loop that was
  the crate's largest missing subsystem. It drives the CABAC engine
  through the per-CTU syntax structures, composing the leaf decode
  primitives with the existing §7.3.8.8 `transform_tree()` recursion:
  - `decode_coding_tree_unit` (§7.3.8.2) — optional §7.3.8.3 `sao()` +
    the §7.3.8.4 coding-quadtree root, producing `CodingTreeUnit`.
  - `decode_sao` (§7.3.8.3) — the full per-CTB SAO param walk: the two
    merge flags, the per-component `sao_type_idx` / offset / band /
    eo-class reads, the §7.4.9.3 `SaoTypeIdx[2]`/eo-class inheritance,
    into `SaoCtbParams` / `SaoComponent`.
  - `decode_coding_quadtree` (§7.3.8.4) — the recursive `split_cu_flag`
    walk with the §7.4.9.4 boundary inference, the §6.5.1
    quantization-group resets at the `Log2MinCuQpDeltaSize` /
    `Log2MinCuChromaQpOffsetSize` thresholds, and the in-picture
    boundary `if( x1 < … )` child guards, into `CodingQuadtree`.
  - `coding_unit` (§7.3.8.5) — the full CU body: `cu_transquant_bypass`,
    `cu_skip_flag`, `pred_mode_flag`, `part_mode`, the PCM gate, the
    intra luma/chroma mode signalling group, the inter `prediction_unit`
    emission per `PartMode`, `rqt_root_cbf`, and entry into the
    transform tree, into `CodingUnit` / `IntraLumaMode`.
  - `prediction_unit` (§7.3.8.6) — the merge / non-merge inter PU walk
    (`merge_flag` / `merge_idx` / `inter_pred_idc` / `ref_idx` /
    `mvd_coding` / `mvp_lX_flag`, with the `mvd_l1_zero_flag` + PRED_BI
    zero-inference), into `PredictionUnit`.
  - `CtuGrid` — a per-CTU `CtDepth` / `cu_skip_flag` neighbour grid at
    `MinCbSizeY` granularity feeding the §9.3.4.2.2 `split_cu_flag` /
    `cu_skip_flag` left/above ctxInc derivations.
  - 6 driver tests covering the grid neighbour lookups, SAO decode,
    the min-CB leaf case, and the full I-slice CTU walk.
- `tests/tiny_i_ctu_walk.rs` — end-to-end fixture test driving the
  slice-data walk on the real `tiny-i-only-16x16-main` HEVC bitstream
  (embedded slice NAL, emulation-prevention-stripped, slice-header
  walked to `byte_alignment()`, CABAC engine on the remaining bytes).
  The single 16×16 intra CTU decodes bit-exactly through SAO (type 0
  on Y/Cb/Cr, both merge flags absent at rx==ry==0) and the §7.3.8.4 /
  §7.3.8.5 coding-quadtree / coding-unit structure (one un-split 16×16
  intra PART_2Nx2N CU, one luma PB + one chroma mode).

- `binarization` — the remaining §7.3.8.3 / §7.3.8.5 / §7.3.8.6 leaf
  decode primitives the slice-data CTU/CU walk composes:
  - SAO (§7.3.8.3): `decode_sao_merge_flag` (FL `cMax = 1`, ctxInc 0),
    `decode_sao_type_idx` (TR `cMax = 2`, bin 0 context + bin 1 bypass),
    `decode_sao_offset_abs` (TR, bypass, `cMax` per
    `sao_offset_abs_tr_cmax(bitDepth)`), `decode_sao_offset_sign`
    (FL `cMax = 1` bypass), `decode_sao_band_position` (FL `cMax = 31`,
    5 bypass bins), `decode_sao_eo_class` (FL `cMax = 3`, 2 bypass bins).
  - `part_mode` (§7.3.8.5 / §9.3.3.7 / Table 9-45): `decode_part_mode`
    walks the `CuPredMode` + `log2CbSize` + `amp_enabled_flag`-dependent
    bin string (bins 0..=2 context-coded via the `part_mode[ctxInc]`
    bank, bin 3 bypass) into the `PartMode` enum + `IntraSplitFlag`
    (`PartModeResult`); `part_mode_inferred` for the §7.4.9.5
    not-present `PART_2Nx2N` case; `PartMode::is_amp`.
  - `pcm_flag` / `end_of_slice_segment_flag` (§7.3.8.5 / §7.3.8.1):
    `decode_pcm_flag` / `decode_end_of_slice_segment_flag`, both the
    §9.3.4.3.5 *terminate* path (Table 9-48 `terminate` row).
  - prediction_unit (§7.3.8.6): `decode_merge_idx` (TR
    `cMax = MaxNumMergeCand − 1`, bin 0 context + bypass tail),
    `decode_inter_pred_idc` (§9.3.3.9 / Table 9-47 → `InterPredIdc`),
    `decode_ref_idx` (TR `cMax = num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1`, bins
    0/1 context + bypass tail), `decode_mvp_flag` (FL `cMax = 1`).
  - 20 new unit tests covering the inference paths, AMP classification,
    terminate-path decoders, and the bypass/context bin splits.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 334 (2026-06-18)

- `binarization` — the §7.3.8.4 `split_cu_flag` and §7.3.8.5
  `cu_skip_flag` single-bin decode primitives, the gateway flags of the
  `coding_quadtree( )` / `coding_unit( )` walk:
  - `decode_split_cu_flag` / `decode_cu_skip_flag` — Table 9-43 FL
    `cMax = 1` (one context-coded bin); the bank slot is selected by the
    existing §9.3.4.2.2 / Table 9-49 `split_cu_flag_ctx_inc` /
    `cu_skip_flag_ctx_inc` left/above neighbour ctxInc helpers, and the
    decode itself is a single §9.3.4.3.2 context decision. The §7.3.8.4
    split-presence gate / §7.4.9.4 boundary inference and the §7.3.8.5
    `slice_type != I` read gate remain the caller's responsibility.
  - `cu_pred_mode_from_skip` — the §7.4.9.5 not-present `CuPredMode`
    derivation from `cu_skip_flag` + slice type: `Some(Intra)` for I
    slices, `Some(Skip)` for a P / B skip CU, and `None` for a P / B
    non-skip CU (signalling a `pred_mode_flag` read is still required).
  - `SPLIT_CU_FLAG_FL_{CMAX,NBITS}` / `CU_SKIP_FLAG_FL_{CMAX,NBITS}`
    binarization-shape constants.
  - 9 new unit tests (zero / one / one-bin-consumed paths for both
    decoders, the FL shapes, and the four `cu_pred_mode_from_skip`
    branches).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 330 (2026-06-18)

- `transform_tree` module — the §7.3.8.8 `transform_tree( x0, y0,
  xBase, yBase, log2TrafoSize, trafoDepth, blkIdx )` recursion, the
  missing rung between the §7.3.8.5 `coding_unit( )` walk and the
  §7.3.8.10 `transform_unit( )` leaf:
  - `decode_transform_tree` — mirrors the §7.3.8.8 syntax table exactly:
    the `split_transform_flag` presence gate (`log2TrafoSize <=
    MaxTbLog2SizeY && log2TrafoSize > MinTbLog2SizeY && trafoDepth <
    MaxTrafoDepth && !(IntraSplitFlag && trafoDepth == 0)`) with the
    §7.4.9.8 forced-split inference (`log2TrafoSize > MaxTbLog2SizeY`,
    `IntraSplitFlag` at depth 0, `interSplitFlag`); the per-node
    `cbf_cb` / `cbf_cr` reads gated by the inheritance condition
    (`trafoDepth == 0 || cbf_cX[xBase][yBase][trafoDepth − 1]`) with the
    `ChromaArrayType == 2` lower-half companions (`!split_transform_flag
    || log2TrafoSize == 3`); the four-way quarter-size recursion; and at
    each leaf the §7.3.8.8 `cbf_luma` presence condition
    (`CuPredMode == MODE_INTRA || trafoDepth != 0 || cbf_cb || cbf_cr ||
    (ChromaArrayType == 2 && (cbf_cb_lower || cbf_cr_lower))`) before
    invoking `decode_transform_unit`. One `QuantGroupState` is threaded
    through the whole subtree so the `delta_qp()` / `chroma_qp_offset()`
    gates fire once per quantization group.
  - `TransformTreeParams` (the per-CU geometry + context: `MaxTbLog2SizeY`
    / `MinTbLog2SizeY` / `MaxTrafoDepth`, `IntraSplitFlag`,
    `interSplitFlag`, `CuPredMode`, `ChromaArrayType`, and the
    `TransformUnitParams` template) and the `TransformTree`
    `Split { … children } / Leaf { cbf_luma, unit }` decoded result.
- `binarization` — four new §7.3.8.8 single-bin decode primitives the
  recursion composes: `decode_split_transform_flag` /
  `split_transform_flag_inferred`, `decode_cbf_luma` /
  `cbf_luma_inferred`, `decode_cbf_cb` / `decode_cbf_cr` /
  `cbf_chroma_inferred` (each an FL `cMax = 1` context-coded bin per
  §9.3.4.2.1 / Table 9-48, with the §7.4.9.8 not-present inference).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 325 (2026-06-16)

- `transform_unit` module — the §7.3.8.10 `transform_unit( x0, y0,
  xBase, yBase, log2TrafoSize, trafoDepth, blkIdx )` syntax driver, the
  leaf the §7.3.8.8 `transform_tree()` recursion bottoms out in:
  - `decode_transform_unit` — walks the §7.3.8.10 table exactly: the
    `cbfChroma` derivation (including the `ChromaArrayType == 2`
    lower-half companions), the adaptive-colour-transform predicate
    gating `tu_residual_act_flag`, the `delta_qp()` / `chroma_qp_offset()`
    blocks (each gated by the per-quantization-group `IsCuQpDeltaCoded` /
    `IsCuChromaQpOffsetCoded` state in `QuantGroupState`), the luma
    `residual_coding()`, and the chroma path — both the in-place branch
    (with the §7.3.8.12 `cross_comp_pred()` prelude and the
    `log2TrafoSizeC = Max(2, log2TrafoSize − (ChromaArrayType == 3 ? 0 :
    1))` chroma size, plus the `ChromaArrayType == 2` stacked-sub-block
    pair) and the `blkIdx == 3` deferred-chroma branch where the chroma
    residuals are coded against the parent node at the last luma leaf.
  - `TransformUnitParams` / `TransformUnit` / `QuantGroupState` /
    `CuPredMode` — typed inputs, decoded result, and the
    across-transform-unit quant-group decode state.
- `binarization` — two new §7.3.8.10 / §7.3.8.12 primitive decoders the
  driver composes:
  - `decode_cross_comp_pred` — §7.3.8.12 `cross_comp_pred( x0, y0, c )`:
    the TR(`cMax = 4`) `log2_res_scale_abs_plus1[ c ]` prefix plus the
    conditional `res_scale_sign_flag[ c ]`, with the §7.4.9.12
    `ResScaleVal` derivation (equations 7-79 / 7-80) surfaced on
    `CrossCompPred`.
  - `decode_tu_residual_act_flag` — §7.3.8.10 `tu_residual_act_flag`
    (FL `cMax = 1`, Table 9-39 / Table 9-48 ctxInc 0), plus the §7.4.9.10
    `tu_residual_act_flag_inferred` helper.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 321 (2026-06-16)

- `inter_pred` module — §8.5.3.3.3 fractional sample interpolation plus
  the §8.5.3.3.4.2 default weighted sample prediction combine, the first
  inter-prediction sample-generation increment:
  - `RefPlane` — a row-major reference-picture sample plane with the
    §8.5.3.3.3 `Clip3( 0, dim − 1, … )` edge extension (equations 8-222 /
    8-223 for luma, 8-239 / 8-240 for chroma) so the filters can index
    with the raw `xInt + i` / `yInt + j` offsets.
  - `interp_luma_block` — §8.5.3.3.3.2 separable 8-tap quarter-pel luma
    interpolation (equations 8-224..8-238), with Table 8-8 phase
    selection. `shift1 = Min(4, BitDepthY − 8)`, `shift2 = 6`,
    `shift3 = Max(2, 14 − BitDepthY)`; full-pel is `A << shift3`.
  - `interp_chroma_block` — §8.5.3.3.3.3 separable 4-tap eighth-pel chroma
    interpolation (equations 8-241..8-261), with Table 8-9 phase
    selection.
  - `default_weighted_pred` — §8.5.3.3.4.2 uni- / bi-predictive combine
    (equations 8-262..8-264, the `weighted_pred_flag == 0` path), with
    `shift1 = Max(2, 14 − bitDepth)`, `shift2 = Max(3, 15 − bitDepth)`,
    clipping to `[0, (1 << bitDepth) − 1]`.
  - `InterPredError` — empty / mismatched plane, empty block, out-of-range
    fraction, out-of-range bit depth, and array-length-mismatch surfaces.

  The interpolation carries the `14 − BitDepth`-bit intermediate precision
  the spec keeps between §8.5.3.3.3 and §8.5.3.3.4; the combine clips to
  the sample range. The §8.5.3.1 / §8.5.3.2 MV / merge derivation, the
  §8.5.3.3.1 block-walk driver, and the §8.5.3.3.4.3 explicit weighted
  path remain follow-ups. 12 unit tests (flat-plane invariants for all
  4×4 luma and 8×8 chroma phases, hand-computed kernel values, edge
  extension, uni- / bi-predictive combine, clipping, 10-bit shift3, and an
  end-to-end interpolate-then-combine pipeline).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 318 (2026-06-16)

- `availability` module — §6.4 availability processes plus the §6.5.1 /
  §6.5.2 picture-level scanning conversions they depend on. This is the
  neighbour-availability derivation that produces the per-sample
  "available for intra prediction" markings consumed by `intra_pred`:
  - `PictureTiling::new` / `TilingParams` — §6.5.1 CTB raster-scan ↔
    tile-scan conversion. Derives `colWidth` / `rowHeight` (eqs. 6-3 /
    6-4, both the `uniform_spacing_flag` even-split and the explicit
    `column_width_minus1` / `row_height_minus1` forms), `colBd` /
    `rowBd` (eqs. 6-5 / 6-6), `CtbAddrRsToTs` / `CtbAddrTsToRs` (eqs.
    6-7 / 6-8, the tile-scan permutation and its inverse), and `TileId`
    (eq. 6-9). Rejects zero geometry, `CtbLog2SizeY < MinTbLog2SizeY`,
    mis-sized explicit tile arrays, and tile sizes that overflow the
    picture.
  - `PictureTiling::min_tb_addr_zs` — §6.5.2 eq. 6-10. The
    `MinTbAddrZs[ x ][ y ]` z-scan address of a minimum block,
    interleaving the within-CTB Morton (z) order of the block's low
    `( x, y )` bits with the tile-scan CTB address in the high bits.
  - `PictureTiling::z_scan_availability` — §6.4.1. `availableN` from
    the in-picture boundary test (eq. 6-2), the decode-order test
    (`minBlockAddrN > minBlockAddrCurr`), the `SliceAddrRs`
    slice-segment-boundary test, and the `TileId` tile-boundary test.
    Takes a caller-supplied `slice_addr_rs` CTB→`SliceAddrRs` lookup.
  - `PictureTiling::prediction_block_availability` — §6.4.2. Wraps the
    z-scan query with the `sameCb` short-cut (the NxN partIdx-1
    forced-FALSE branch for the not-yet-decoded co-CU region) and the
    final `MODE_INTRA` masking, via a caller-supplied `CuPredMode`
    lookup.
  - 18 unit tests, all expected values hand-derived from the §6.4 /
    §6.5 equations (single-tile identity, 2×2-tile tile-scan reorder,
    explicit-width tiles + overflow rejection, Morton interleave,
    and the availability boundary/slice/tile/sameCb/intra-mask cases).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 315 (2026-06-15)

- `intra_pred` module — §8.4.4.2 intra sample prediction, the predictor
  core that turns marked neighbour samples into the `(nTbS)x(nTbS)`
  `predSamples` array, consuming the §8.4.2 / §8.4.3 mode derivation
  landed in prior rounds:
  - `substitute_reference_samples` — §8.4.4.2.2 reference-sample
    substitution. The bottom-left→corner→top-right sweep fills every
    sample marked "not available for intra prediction" (step-1 seed of
    `p[ −1 ][ 2*nTbS−1 ]`, then the single forward propagation that
    covers steps 2 and 3); when no neighbour is available, all samples
    take the mid-level `1 << ( bitDepth − 1 )`.
  - `filter_reference_samples` / `reference_filter_flag` — §8.4.4.2.3.
    The Table 8-4 `filterFlag` gate (suppressed for `INTRA_DC` and
    `nTbS == 4`), the `[1 2 1] >> 2` smoothing (eqs. 8-41..8-45), and the
    `nTbS == 32` luma `biIntFlag` bi-linear interpolation (eqs.
    8-36..8-40).
  - `predict_planar` — §8.4.4.2.4 `INTRA_PLANAR` (eq. 8-46).
  - `predict_dc` — §8.4.4.2.5 `INTRA_DC` (`dcVal` eq. 8-47 + the luma
    `nTbS < 32` boundary smoothing eqs. 8-48..8-51).
  - `predict_angular` — §8.4.4.2.6 `INTRA_ANGULAR2..34`. Tables 8-5 /
    8-6 `intraPredAngle` / `invAngle`, the main reference-array
    projection with the negative-angle inverse-angle extension (eqs.
    8-53..8-67), and the mode-26 / mode-10 luma boundary filter (eqs.
    8-60 / 8-68).
  - `intra_predict` / `intra_predict_with_substitution` — §8.4.4.2.1
    steps 1 and 2: the filtering gate
    (`intra_smoothing_disabled_flag == 0 && (cIdx == 0 ||
    ChromaArrayType == 3)`) plus the planar / DC / angular dispatch,
    with the substitution-first variant running the full pipeline from a
    `MarkedReferenceSamples` input.
  - 18 unit tests: substitution (mid-level fallback, sweep propagation,
    step-1 seed, available-value preservation), Table 8-4 boundaries,
    hand-worked planar eq-8-46 / DC eq-8-47..8-50 / angular pure-index
    cells, boundary-filter on/off, and the end-to-end pipeline.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 311 (2026-06-15)

- `binarization` module — the §8.4.2 derivation process for luma intra
  prediction mode, the process the round-40/41 signalling group
  (`prev_intra_luma_pred_flag`, `mpm_idx`, `rem_intra_luma_pred_mode`)
  feeds, completing the luma intra-mode resolution chain alongside the
  round-42 §8.4.3 chroma derivation:
  - `intra_luma_cand_mode_list` — §8.4.2 step 3: builds the three-entry
    `candModeList[ 0..=2 ]` from the two step-2 candidate neighbour modes
    `candIntraPredModeA` / `candIntraPredModeB`. The equal-candidate
    branch splits on `candA < 2` (eqs. 8-21..8-23 ⇒ `{PLANAR, DC,
    ANGULAR26}`) versus the angular case (eqs. 8-24..8-26 — the candidate
    plus its two mod-32-wrapped neighbouring angular modes); the
    distinct-candidate branch fills slots 0/1 (eqs. 8-27/8-28) and picks
    `candModeList[ 2 ]` as the first of `{PLANAR, DC, ANGULAR26}` not
    already present.
  - `derive_intra_pred_mode_y` — §8.4.2 step 4: on the
    [`LumaIntraModeSource::Mpm`] path `IntraPredModeY =
    candModeList[ mpm_idx ]`; on the [`LumaIntraModeSource::Remaining`]
    path the candidate list is sorted ascending (the eqs. 8-29..8-31
    three-compare-and-swap sort) and `rem_intra_luma_pred_mode` is passed
    through the increment pass (`+1` for every sorted candidate at or
    below the running value), mapping the 31-value remaining field onto
    the 35-mode space exclusive of the three most-probable modes.
  - `INTRA_PLANAR` (0), `INTRA_DC` (1), `INTRA_ANGULAR26` (26) and
    `INTRA_PRED_MODE_MAX` (34) — the Table 8-1 mode-name constants.
  - The §8.4.2-step-2 candidate reduction (§6.4.1 availability,
    `CuPredMode` / `pcm_flag` tests, the CTB-row-boundary B clamp) stays
    the slice-data parser's responsibility, consistent with the
    availability-as-input convention of the §9.3.4.2.2 neighbour ctxInc
    derivations.
- 10 new tests (521 total, was 511): the Table 8-1 mode constants; the
  step-3 equal-low (eqs. 8-21..8-23), equal-angular with mod-32 edge
  wraps at modes 2 and 34 (eqs. 8-24..8-26), and distinct-candidate
  first-missing-default (eqs. 8-27/8-28) branches; the all-candidate-pair
  in-range invariant; the step-4 Mpm direct index; the Remaining
  low-mode anchors, the pre-increment ascending sort, and the
  bijection-onto-`(0..=34) \ candModeList` invariant over the full rem
  range; and an end-to-end candModeList → IntraPredModeY composition on
  both paths.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 308 (2026-06-15)

- `binarization` module — the §7.3.8.6 `prediction_unit( )`
  `merge_flag` syntax element:
  - `decode_merge_flag` decodes the single context-coded FL `cMax = 1`
    bin (Table 9-43 shape, Table 9-48 bin-0 `ctxInc = 0`) from the
    CABAC engine. Value 1 selects the merge path (inter-prediction
    parameters inferred from a neighbouring inter-predicted partition,
    `merge_idx` follows); value 0 selects the explicit-motion path.
  - `merge_flag_inferred` applies the §7.4.9.6 not-present inference
    (`CuPredMode == MODE_SKIP ⇒ 1`, otherwise `0`) for the §7.3.8.6
    `cu_skip_flag == 1` path, without entering the engine.
  - `merge_flag_ctx_inc` (= 0) plus the `MERGE_FLAG_FL_CMAX` /
    `MERGE_FLAG_FL_NBITS` shape constants. The Table 9-15 init bank
    (`{110, 154}`, initType 0 = `na`) was already wired in `ctx_init`.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 48 (2026-06-14)

- `binarization` module — the §7.3.8.9 / §7.4.9.9 `mvd_coding( )`
  motion-vector-difference syntax structure:
  - `decode_mvd_component` / `decode_mvd_component_with` decode one
    `mvd_coding( )` component (`compIdx`): the two context-coded
    magnitude flags `abs_mvd_greater0_flag` / `abs_mvd_greater1_flag`
    (Table 9-48 `ctxInc = 0`, Table 9-23 single-context banks via
    `SliceContexts`), the bypass-coded EG1 escape `abs_mvd_minus2`
    (Table 9-43 `EG1`) read only when `abs_mvd_greater1_flag == 1`,
    and the bypass FL sign bit `mvd_sign_flag` (`cMax = 1`) read only
    when `abs_mvd_greater0_flag == 1`.
  - `MvdComponent` carries all four wire fields plus the equation-7-73
    composed signed difference `lMvd`; `mvd_component_value` applies
    the not-present inferences (`abs_mvd_greater1_flag` ⇒ 0,
    `abs_mvd_minus2` ⇒ −1, `mvd_sign_flag` ⇒ 0).
  - `abs_mvd_greater0_flag_ctx_inc` / `abs_mvd_greater1_flag_ctx_inc`
    expose the Table 9-48 `ctxInc`; `ABS_MVD_GREATER_FLAG_FL_CMAX`,
    `MVD_SIGN_FLAG_FL_CMAX`, `ABS_MVD_MINUS2_EG_K` expose the
    Table 9-43 binarization parameters.
  - `read_eg_k_with` factors the §9.3.3.3 k-th-order Exp-Golomb decode
    over a generic bin reader, shared with the engine-driven
    `decode_eg_k`.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 47 (2026-06-14)

- `transform` module — the §8.6.2 / §8.6.3 / §8.6.4 scaling,
  transformation and residual-array construction process that turns the
  decoded `TransCoeffLevel[ xC ][ yC ]` array of one transform block
  into the `(nTbS)x(nTbS)` array `r` of residual samples:
  - `scale_coefficients` — the §8.6.3 scaling (dequantization) process.
    Each `TransCoeffLevel[ x ][ y ]` is multiplied by `m[ x ][ y ]`
    (a flat 16, or `ScalingFactor[ sizeId ][ matrixId ][ x ][ y ]`), the
    `levelScale[ qP % 6 ]` rational-step list (`{40,45,51,57,64,72}`)
    and `1 << ( qP / 6 )`, then offset-rounded by `bdShift`
    (equation 8-301/8-305) and clipped to `[ coeffMin, coeffMax ]`
    (equations 8-300..8-309), with `i64` product intermediates for the
    extended-precision ranges.
  - `inverse_transform` — the §8.6.4 separable inverse transform: the
    column then row §8.6.4.2 one-dimensional transform, selecting the
    equation-8-316 4x4 DST-VII matrix for `MODE_INTRA` 4x4 luma
    (`trType == 1`) and the equations-8-318..8-321 32x32 DCT-II matrix
    (subsampled at stride `1 << (5 − log2(nTbS))` per equation 8-317)
    for every other block, with the equation-8-314 intermediate
    `(e + 64) >> 7` offset-round and clip.
  - `residual_block` — the §8.6.2 orchestration over
    `cu_transquant_bypass_flag` (the equation-8-297 `rotateCoeffs`
    pass-through), `transform_skip_flag` (the equation-8-298 `tsShift`
    left-shift), and the full scale-then-transform path, applying the
    equation-8-299 final `bdShift` offset-round (equations 8-294..8-296).
  - The §7.4.5 `CoeffMin` / `CoeffMax` derivation (`coeff_range`,
    equations 7-27..7-30) and the `LEVEL_SCALE` / `Component` /
    `PredMode` / `BlockParams` / `TransformError` public surface.
  - 17 tests: hand-computed §8.6.3 single-DC / negative-level /
    saturation scaling, the transquant-bypass verbatim + `rotateCoeffs`
    mirror copies, an exact 4x4 inverse-DCT case, the DST-vs-DCT
    `trType` selection (luma-intra-4x4 only) and the chroma / inter
    exclusions, the `transform_skip` `tsShift` path, the DCT subsample
    stride, matrix-cell pins, and the size / length / bit-depth error
    paths. Total tests 495 (was 478).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 46 (2026-06-14)

- `sei` module — the §7.3.2.4 / §7.3.5 / §D.2 Supplemental Enhancement
  Information parse:
  - The §7.3.5 `sei_message()` framing with the extensible
    `payloadType` / `payloadSize` byte runs (every `0xFF` adds 255, the
    first non-`0xFF` byte is the final term), and the §7.3.2.4
    `sei_rbsp()` `do … while( more_rbsp_data() )` message loop
    (`parse_sei_rbsp`), terminating positionally at the
    `rbsp_trailing_bits()` `0x80` stop byte.
  - The §D.2 `sei_payload()` dispatch split by `nal_unit_type`
    (`PREFIX_SEI_NUT` 39 / `SUFFIX_SEI_NUT` 40 via `SeiNalType`). Eight
    payload types are decoded into typed structs: `recovery_point` (6),
    `user_data_registered_itu_t_t35` (4), `user_data_unregistered` (5),
    `active_parameter_sets` (129), `decoded_picture_hash` (132,
    suffix-only, MD5 / CRC / checksum variants),
    `mastering_display_colour_volume` (137), `content_light_level_info`
    (144), and `alternative_transfer_characteristics` (147). Every
    other (or branch-illegal) `payloadType` is carried verbatim as
    `SeiPayload::Reserved`, so the framing always advances by the
    declared `payloadSize`.
  - Overrun / truncation are surfaced as `SeiError::PayloadSizeOverrun`
    / `TruncatedHeader` / `TruncatedPayload`. 31 new tests cover the
    extensible byte runs, each typed payload (including negative
    `recovery_poc_cnt` and the three `decoded_picture_hash` variants),
    the prefix/suffix dispatch (prefix-only payload in a suffix NAL ⇒
    Reserved and vice versa), multi-message RBSPs, and the error paths.
    Total tests now 478 (was 447).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 45 (2026-06-12)

- `ctx_init` module — the complete §9.3.2.2 context-variable
  initialization layer:
  - All 38 `initValue` tables (Tables 9-5..9-42) transcribed from the
    staged specification PDFs, one flat constant per table laid out on
    the printed ctxIdx axis, covering every context-coded syntax
    element of §7.3.8.1..§7.3.8.12 (the §9.3.2.2 exceptions
    `end_of_slice_segment_flag` / `end_of_subset_one_bit` / `pcm_flag`
    keep the NOTE 2 non-adapting `ctxTable == 0` state). Both staged
    PDFs (v8 08/2021 and v11 01/2026) were cross-checked and agree on
    every cell.
  - The Table 9-4 ctxIdx-span selection: `uniform_init_values` for the
    regular contiguous three-`initType` layouts, `inter_init_values`
    for the inter-only two-column tables (returns `None` at
    `initType == 0`), `sig_coeff_flag_init_values` for the Table 9-29
    42-per-type body plus the ctxIdx 126..131 transform-skip tail, and
    dedicated handling for the irregular `part_mode` (1 + 4 + 4),
    `cbf_cb`/`cbf_cr` (4 × 3 + the ctxIdx 12/13/14 fifth context),
    `abs_mvd_greater0_flag`/`greater1_flag` (Table 9-23 interleave),
    `transform_skip_flag` and `explicit_rdpcm_*` (luma + shared-chroma
    pairs) layouts.
  - `SliceContexts` — the whole per-slice context array (185 adapting
    context variables per `initType`; Table 9-4 shared-variable groups
    such as `sao_merge_left/up`, `ref_idx_l0/l1`, `mvp_l0/l1_flag`,
    `cbf_cb/cr` and the palette copy-above pair stored once).
    `SliceContexts::init(initType, SliceQpY)` runs equations 9-4..9-6
    over every bank; `SliceContexts::for_slice(slice_type,
    cabac_init_flag, SliceQpY)` adds the equation 9-7 `initType`
    derivation. Inter-only banks at `initType == 0` take the NOTE 2
    non-adapting placeholder (`pStateIdx = 63`), unreachable from any
    table entry, so an accidental I-slice read is recognisable.
  - `ResidualContexts::init(initType, SliceQpY)` — the Table 9-26..9-31
    per-`initType` bank initialization for the §7.3.8.11
    `residual_coding( )` driver (`init_uniform` stays as the scripted
    bring-up constructor). With this the CABAC engine is
    slice-initialisable end-to-end for `initType` 0 / 1 / 2.
- 11 new tests (447 total, was 436): table-shape pins for all 38
  tables; the Table 9-26 == Table 9-27 printed-value identity;
  hand-evaluated `(pStateIdx, valMps)` pins across QPs 0..51 for
  regular, inter-only and irregular layouts; whole-array smoke tests
  per `initType` (every table-derived state in 0..=62, placeholders
  exactly on the inter-only banks, 185-context count); the
  equation 9-7 routing matrix (P/B `cabac_init_flag` swap, I-slice
  invariance); span-helper slicing pins including the Table 9-29
  transform-skip tail; and the `initType > 2` rejection.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 44 (2026-06-12)

- cargo-fuzz scaffold under `fuzz/` restoring the scheduled Fuzz
  workflow (the post-rebuild tree had no fuzz targets, so the daily
  run failed at discovery). Two harnesses, each run ≥ 5 minutes
  locally under AddressSanitizer + debug assertions after the fixes
  below:
  - `parse_annexb` — Annex B NAL walk (§B.1) → §7.3.1.2 header →
    VPS (§7.3.2.1) / SPS (§7.3.2.2) / PPS (§7.3.2.3.1) dispatch, plus
    the §7.3.6.1 `slice_segment_header()` parse against the last
    activated SPS + PPS pair. Seeded from the
    `docs/video/h265/fixtures/` Annex B corpus.
  - `decode_residual` — the §7.3.8.11 `residual_coding( )` driver
    through the §9.3 arithmetic engine; the leading input bytes map
    onto the driver configuration (transform size, chroma, the
    §7.4.9.11 scanIdx derivation inputs, sign-data-hiding gates, the
    uniform context init). Seeded with synthetic configurations.
- SPS parse-time validation of the §7.4.3.2.1 block-size derivations:
  `CtbLog2SizeY` (eqs. 7-10 / 7-11) must lie in the Annex A profile
  bound 4..=6, `MinTbLog2SizeY` must be `< MinCbLog2SizeY`,
  `MaxTbLog2SizeY` must be `≤ Min( CtbLog2SizeY, 5 )`, and both
  transform-hierarchy depths `≤ CtbLog2SizeY − MinTbLog2SizeY`; plus
  the §A.4.1 item-b/c picture-dimension ceiling
  (`Sqrt( MaxLumaPs * 8 )` = 33 776 at the largest Table A.8 level).
- PPS parse-time validation of the §A.4.1 item-f tile-grid bounds
  (`num_tile_columns_minus1 < 40`, `num_tile_rows_minus1 < 44`, the
  largest Table A.8 entries), which also stops the explicit
  column/row arrays from pre-allocating off the raw wire count.

### Fixed — clean-room rebuild round 44 (2026-06-12)

- Fuzz finding (`parse_annexb`): an SPS with out-of-range
  coding-block-size fields survived the parse and panicked every
  downstream `CtbSizeY = 1 << CtbLog2SizeY` (eq. 7-13) re-derivation
  (first hit in the slice-header `PicSizeInCtbsY` path). Rejected at
  SPS parse time; regression tests pin all the new bounds.
- Fuzz finding (`decode_residual`): the §9.3.3.11
  `coeff_abs_level_remaining` EGk escape could compose a value past
  u32 on a non-conformant bypass-bin stream (32 leading zeros +
  all-ones suffix) and overflow. The composition now saturates in
  u64, and the §7.3.8.11 driver clamps the level magnitude at the
  widest §7.4.9.11 / eqs. 7-27..7-30 profile bound (±2²²);
  conforming streams are bit-identical. A regression test pins the
  maximal-escape shape.
- Fuzz finding (`parse_annexb`): the §7.3.4 `scaling_list_data()`
  parse accepted an unbounded `scaling_list_delta_coef` and
  overflowed the i32 `nextCoef + scaling_list_delta_coef + 256` sum.
  The §7.4.5 −128..=127 range is now enforced (new
  `ScalingListError::DeltaCoefOutOfRange` variant); a regression
  test pins the one-past-the-bound value.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 43 (2026-06-12)

- §7.3.8.11 `residual_coding( )` syntax driver — the new [`residual`]
  module composes the rounds-26..35 residual primitives into the full
  coefficient-decode loop reconstructing one transform block's
  `TransCoeffLevel[ ][ ]` array: the do-while locate of
  `(lastSubBlock, lastScanPos)` from `LastSignificantCoeff{X,Y}`
  (with the eq. 7-78 vertical-scan swap), the reverse sub-block scan
  with `coded_sub_block_flag` decode and the §7.4.9.11 not-present
  inferences, the per-sub-block `sig_coeff_flag` loop with the full
  §9.3.4.2.5 sigCtx branch dispatch (eq. 9-40 / Table 9-50 / eq. 9-42
  DC / eqs. 9-43..9-53) and both inference rules (last-significant;
  `inferSbDcSigCoeffFlag` DC), the `coeff_abs_level_greater1_flag`
  pass with the `numGreater1Flag < 8` cap and lazy §9.3.4.2.6
  sub-block entry, the at-most-one `coeff_abs_level_greater2_flag`,
  the `signHidden` derivation + `coeff_sign_flag` gates + odd-parity
  `sumAbsLevel` negation, and the level loop with the §7.3.8.11
  remaining-presence test and the §9.3.3.11 per-sub-block eq.-9-24
  Rice adaptation.
  - [`residual::decode_residual_coding_with`] — bin-source-generic
    driver core; [`residual::ResidualBinSource`] +
    [`residual::ResidualElement`] identify each context-coded request.
  - [`residual::decode_residual_coding`] /
    [`residual::EngineResidualBinSource`] — the §9.3.4.3
    arithmetic-engine binding over [`residual::ResidualContexts`]
    (banks sized 18 / 18 / 4 / 44 / 24 / 6 per the Table 9-26..9-31
    ctxIdx spans, exposed as `*_CTX_COUNT` constants;
    [`residual::ResidualContexts::init_uniform`] is bring-up
    scaffolding until the initValue transcription lands).
  - [`residual::residual_coding_scan_idx`] — the §7.4.9.11 scanIdx
    derivation; [`residual::ResidualBlock`] — the reconstructed
    coefficient array; [`residual::ResidualCodingError`].
- The Table 9-50 `ctxIdxMap` doc-comment on
  [`binarization::SIG_COEFF_FLAG_CTX_IDX_MAP_LOG2_TRAFO_SIZE_2`] now
  cites the staged docs errata entry
  (`docs/video/h265/h265-errata-and-clarifications.md` #93) pinning
  the PDF-truncated `i = 15` cell to 8 (the constant already carried
  that value from the round-32 pair-symmetry reconstruction).
- 14 new tests (427 total, was 413): DC-only luma/chroma context
  routing, 4×4 full sweep with Table 9-50 ctxInc cross-checks, 8×8
  two-sub-block walk (csbf ctxInc, DC inference, eq.-9-58 ctxSet
  bump), sign-data-hiding parity flip + disabled counterpart,
  greater-1 cap with the `numSigCoeff >= 8` threshold, eq.-9-24 Rice
  adaptation, vertical-scan swap, transform-skip sigCtx routing,
  scanIdx derivation matrix, input validation, and two engine-backed
  runs.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 42 (2026-06-11)

- §9.3.3.8 / Table 9-46 + Table 9-48 entries for `intra_chroma_pred_mode`
  (H.265 §7.3.8.5, §7.4.9.5) — the chroma-mode field that follows the
  round-40/41 luma-mode group, plus the §8.4.3 `IntraPredModeC`
  derivation (Tables 8-2 and 8-3). Unlike the generic Table 9-43
  shapes, this element has its own binarization process: the
  single-bin string `0` carries value 4 and a `1` prefix is followed
  by a two-bit FL bypass suffix carrying values 0..=3. Table 9-48
  marks bin 0 context-coded with `ctxInc = 0` (Table 9-13 supplies
  `initValue = {63, 152, 152}` for initType 0 / 1 / 2 — the element is
  read in I, P and B slices) and bins 1..2 `bypass`. Presence follows
  the §7.3.8.5 `ChromaArrayType` gates: once per CU when
  `ChromaArrayType` is 1 or 2, once per luma prediction block when 3,
  absent when 0 (§8.4.3 is only invoked when `ChromaArrayType != 0`).
  - [`binarization::INTRA_CHROMA_PRED_MODE_SAME_AS_LUMA`] (= 4) — the
    Table 9-46 single-bin value; Table 8-2 row 4 sets `modeIdx` to
    `IntraPredModeY` itself.
  - [`binarization::INTRA_CHROMA_PRED_MODE_SUFFIX_FL_NBITS`] (= 2) —
    the Table 9-46 FL suffix width behind the `1` prefix.
  - [`binarization::intra_chroma_pred_mode_ctx_inc`] — Table 9-48
    bin-0 row: `ctxInc = 0`.
  - [`binarization::decode_intra_chroma_pred_mode`] — engine-driven
    decode: one `decode_decision` for the prefix, then (only on a `1`
    prefix) two MSB-first bypass bins. Output is always in
    `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.
  - [`binarization::intra_pred_mode_c_mode_idx`] — Table 8-2: rows
    0..=3 select the base mode from `{0, 26, 10, 1}` substituting 34
    on a collision with `IntraPredModeY`; row 4 tracks the luma mode.
  - [`binarization::INTRA_PRED_MODE_C_CHROMA_422_MAP`] /
    [`binarization::intra_pred_mode_c_chroma_422`] — the Table 8-3
    35-entry remap applied when `ChromaArrayType == 2`.
  - [`binarization::derive_intra_pred_mode_c`] — the full §8.4.3
    output: Table 8-2 `modeIdx`, then Table 8-3 iff
    `ChromaArrayType == 2`, else pass-through.
- Test count: 403 → 413 (+10 new tests covering the Table 9-46 shape
  constants; the Table 9-48 `ctxInc = 0` anchor; the `0`-prefix ⇒
  value-4 single-bin path (with engine-offset cross-check); the
  `1`-prefix two-suffix-bin wrapper-vs-raw-replay agreement (value +
  engine offset); the `{0..4}` output-domain sweep over both context
  polarities; the full Table 8-2 row/column matrix incl. the row-4
  luma-tracking column; Table 8-3 spot anchors + the X ≤ 2
  pass-through; a Table 8-3 structural cross-check (non-decreasing,
  all entries ≤ 34); and the §8.4.3 combined-derivation 4:2:2 vs
  non-4:2:2 routing).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 41 (2026-06-10)

- §9.3.4.2 / Table 9-43 + Table 9-48 entries for the two §7.3.8.5
  intra-PB luma-mode fields that follow `prev_intra_luma_pred_flag`:
  `mpm_idx` and `rem_intra_luma_pred_mode` (H.265 §7.4.9.2). Both are
  fully bypass-coded (Table 9-48 marks every bin `bypass`, so neither
  consumes a context model). Presence is exactly the round-40
  [`binarization::LumaIntraModeSource`] selection: `Mpm` (flag == 1) ⇒
  `mpm_idx` present and `IntraPredModeY = candModeList[ mpm_idx ]` per
  §8.4.2; `Remaining` (flag == 0) ⇒ `rem_intra_luma_pred_mode` present
  and seeds the §8.4.2 step-2 `IntraPredModeY` before the sorted
  candModeList increment pass. The two are mutually exclusive per the
  §7.3.8.5 `if( prev_intra_luma_pred_flag ) … else …` syntax.
  - [`binarization::MPM_IDX_TR_CMAX`] (= 2) and
    [`binarization::MPM_IDX_TR_C_RICE_PARAM`] (= 0) — Table 9-43 TR
    shape; with `cRiceParam = 0` the §9.3.3.10 TR collapses to
    truncated-unary (`0` / `10` / `11` for values 0 / 1 / 2).
  - [`binarization::decode_mpm_idx`] — drives the truncated-unary
    prefix through the §9.3.4.3.4 bypass decoder; a `0` bin terminates
    at value 0, otherwise a second bin distinguishes 1 from 2. Output
    is always in `0..=2` (the three-entry §8.4.2 candModeList).
  - [`binarization::REM_INTRA_LUMA_PRED_MODE_FL_CMAX`] (= 31) and
    [`binarization::REM_INTRA_LUMA_PRED_MODE_FL_NBITS`] (= 5) — Table
    9-43 FL shape; §9.3.3.5 `Ceil(Log2(cMax + 1)) = Ceil(Log2(32)) = 5`.
  - [`binarization::decode_rem_intra_luma_pred_mode`] — reads the five
    FL bypass bins MSB-first via
    [`cabac::CabacEngine::decode_bypass_bits`]. Output is always in
    `0..=31`.
- §9.3.4.2.5 Table 9-50 `ctxIdxMap[ 15 ]`: the round-32 `sig_coeff_flag`
  path reconstructed this entry `= 8` by pair-symmetry; the staged docs
  errata #93 now formally confirms it (`= 8`; the PDF truncation at
  `i = 15` is a layout artefact). The existing
  [`binarization::SIG_COEFF_FLAG_CTX_IDX_MAP_LOG2_TRAFO_SIZE_2`] already

  post-read engine-offset cross-check); the `rem_intra_luma_pred_mode`
  five-bypass-bin wrapper-vs-direct agreement (value + engine offset);
  and the `rem_intra_luma_pred_mode` `0..=31` range invariant).

- §9.3.4.2 / Table 9-48 entry for `prev_intra_luma_pred_flag` lands in
  the [`binarization`] module — the per-luma-prediction-block bit that
  selects, for an intra CU, whether the luma intra prediction mode is
  taken from the §8.4.2 most-probable-mode list (`mpm_idx` follows) or
  from the remaining-mode field (`rem_intra_luma_pred_mode` follows),
  per H.265 §7.3.8.5, §7.4.9.2. Per Table 9-43 the flag is FL with
  `cMax = 1` (a single context-coded bin); Table 9-48's row lists
  `ctxInc = 0` for bin 0 and `na` for every later binIdx column.
  Table 9-12 supplies three ctxIdx slots with
  `initValue = {184, 154, 183}` for initType 0, 1 and 2 — unlike
  `pred_mode_flag`, this element is read in I, P and B slices (intra
  CUs occur in every slice type), so all three initType slots are
  populated. The flag is always present when the §7.3.8.5 intra-PB
  loop reaches it (no inferred-value rule).
  - [`binarization::PREV_INTRA_LUMA_PRED_FLAG_FL_CMAX`] — Table 9-43
    shape: `cMax = 1`.
  - [`binarization::PREV_INTRA_LUMA_PRED_FLAG_FL_NBITS`] — §9.3.3.5
    `Ceil(Log2(cMax + 1))` collapsed to the `cMax = 1` constant `1`.
  - [`binarization::prev_intra_luma_pred_flag_ctx_inc`] — Table 9-48
    bin-0 row: `ctxInc = 0` (three Table 9-12 ctxIdx slots, selected
    at slice-init scope by the Table 9-4 initType-to-ctxIdx mapping).
  - [`binarization::LumaIntraModeSource`] — two-variant enum capturing
    the §7.4.9.2 selection: `Mpm` (flag == 1, §8.4.2 candidate list) /
    `Remaining` (flag == 0, `rem_intra_luma_pred_mode`).
  - [`binarization::luma_intra_mode_source_from_flag`] — folds a
    decoded flag into the enum: `1 ⇒ Mpm`, `0 ⇒ Remaining`.
  - [`binarization::decode_prev_intra_luma_pred_flag`] — engine-driven
    decode primitive that reads the single FL bin using the
    caller-allocated Table 9-12 context and returns the decoded `u8`.
- Test count: 389 → 396 (+7 new `prev_intra_luma_pred_flag` tests
  covering the Table 9-48 `ctxInc = 0` anchor; the Table 9-43 FL shape
  (`cMax = 1`, `Ceil(Log2(2)) = 1` `nBits` cross-check); the
  `luma_intra_mode_source_from_flag` mapping (`1 ⇒ Mpm`,
  `0 ⇒ Remaining`); the `LumaIntraModeSource` variant distinctness
  anchor; the engine-driven decode for the valMps = 0 / valMps = 1
  contexts (with `LumaIntraModeSource` cross-check); and the
  exactly-one-bin-per-invocation anchor across two back-to-back
  contexts on the same engine).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 39 (2026-06-09)

- §9.3.4.2 / Table 9-48 entry for `pred_mode_flag` lands in the
  [`binarization`] module — the per-CU bit that selects between
  MODE_INTER (value 0) and MODE_INTRA (value 1) inside a P or B
  slice (H.265 §7.3.8.5, §7.4.9.5). Per Table 9-43 the flag is FL
  with `cMax = 1` (a single context-coded bin); Table 9-48's row
  lists `ctxInc = 0` for bin 0 and `na` for every later binIdx
  column. Table 9-10 supplies two ctxIdx slots with
  `initValue = 149` at initType 1 and `initValue = 134` at
  initType 2 (initType 0 is `na` per Table 9-4 — the §7.3.8.5
  `slice_type != I` guard skips the read for I slices entirely).
  When the §7.3.8.5 guard fails the flag is not coded on the wire
  and §7.4.9.5 derives `CuPredMode` directly: I slice ⇒ MODE_INTRA;
  P or B slice with `cu_skip_flag == 1` ⇒ MODE_SKIP.
  - [`binarization::PRED_MODE_FLAG_FL_CMAX`] — Table 9-43 shape:
    `cMax = 1`.
  - [`binarization::PRED_MODE_FLAG_FL_NBITS`] — §9.3.3.5
    `Ceil(Log2(cMax + 1))` collapsed to the `cMax = 1` constant `1`.
  - [`binarization::pred_mode_flag_ctx_inc`] — Table 9-48 bin-0 row:
    `ctxInc = 0` (two Table 9-10 ctxIdx slots, selected at slice-init
    scope by the Table 9-4 initType-to-ctxIdx mapping).
  - [`binarization::CuPredMode`] — three-variant enum capturing the
    §7.4.9.5 mapping: `Inter`, `Intra`, `Skip`. The `Skip` variant is
    reachable only from the not-present inference path on P/B slices.
  - [`binarization::cu_pred_mode_from_flag`] — present-on-wire
    mapping: `0 ⇒ MODE_INTER`, `1 ⇒ MODE_INTRA`.
  - [`binarization::pred_mode_flag_inferred_cu_pred_mode`] — §7.4.9.5
    not-present derivation: `slice_type == I ⇒ MODE_INTRA`;
    `slice_type ∈ {P, B} && cu_skip_flag == 1 ⇒ MODE_SKIP`.
  - [`binarization::decode_pred_mode_flag`] — engine-driven decode
    primitive that reads the single FL bin using the caller-allocated
    Table 9-10 context and returns the decoded `u8`.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 38 (2026-06-08)

- §9.3.4.2 / Table 9-48 entry for `rqt_root_cbf` lands in the
  [`binarization`] module — the inter-CU gate that signals whether the
  `transform_tree( )` syntax structure follows the current coding unit
  (H.265 §7.3.8.5, §7.4.9.5). Per Table 9-43 the flag is FL with
  `cMax = 1` (a single context-coded bin); Table 9-48's row lists
  `ctxInc = 0` for bin 0 and `na` for every later binIdx column.
  Table 9-14 supplies a single ctxIdx slot with `initValue = 79` at
  both initType 1 and initType 2 (initType 0 is `na` per Table 9-4 —
  `rqt_root_cbf` is only ever read in inter slices). The §7.3.8.5
  guard is `CuPredMode != MODE_INTRA && !cu_skip_flag`: the flag is
  read only when that guard holds, otherwise §7.4.9.5 (V8 / 2021
  baseline) infers the value to 1 (the `transform_tree( )` syntax
  structure is taken to be present).
  - [`binarization::RQT_ROOT_CBF_FL_CMAX`] — Table 9-43 shape:
    `cMax = 1`.
  - [`binarization::RQT_ROOT_CBF_FL_NBITS`] — §9.3.3.5
    `Ceil(Log2(cMax + 1))` collapsed to the `cMax = 1` constant `1`.
  - [`binarization::rqt_root_cbf_ctx_inc`] — Table 9-48 bin-0 row:
    `ctxInc = 0` (single Table 9-14 ctxIdx slot).
  - [`binarization::rqt_root_cbf_inferred`] — §7.4.9.5 inferred-value
    helper (`1` — the spec-mandated default when the §7.3.8.5 guard
    fails and the element is not present on the wire).
  - [`binarization::decode_rqt_root_cbf`] — engine-driven decode
    primitive that reads the single FL bin using the caller-allocated
    single Table 9-14 context and returns the decoded `u8`.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 37 (2026-06-08)

- §9.3.4.2 / Table 9-48 entry for `cu_transquant_bypass_flag` lands
  in the [`binarization`] module — the per-CU bypass switch that,
  when set, replaces the §8.6 / §8.7 scaling + transform +
  in-loop-filter path with a verbatim residual passthrough (H.265
  §7.3.8.5, §7.4.9.5). Per Table 9-43 the flag is FL with
  `cMax = 1` (a single context-coded bin); Table 9-48's row lists
  `ctxInc = 0` for bin 0 and `na` for every later binIdx column.
  Table 9-8 supplies the single context's `initValue = 154` at all
  three initType slots. The PPS gate is
  `transquant_bypass_enabled_flag` (§7.4.3.3.1): the flag is read
  only when the PPS field is 1, otherwise §7.4.9.5 infers the value
  to 0 (the normal scaling-and-transform path).
  - [`binarization::CU_TRANSQUANT_BYPASS_FLAG_FL_CMAX`] — Table 9-43
    shape: `cMax = 1`.
  - [`binarization::CU_TRANSQUANT_BYPASS_FLAG_FL_NBITS`] — §9.3.3.5
    `Ceil(Log2(cMax + 1))` collapsed to the `cMax = 1` constant `1`.
  - [`binarization::cu_transquant_bypass_flag_ctx_inc`] — Table 9-48
    bin-0 row: `ctxInc = 0` (single Table 9-8 ctxIdx slot).
  - [`binarization::cu_transquant_bypass_flag_inferred`] — §7.4.9.5
    inferred-value helper (`0` — the spec-mandated default when the
    PPS gate is 0 and the element is not present on the wire).
  - [`binarization::decode_cu_transquant_bypass_flag`] — engine-driven
    decode primitive that reads the single FL bin using the
    caller-allocated single Table 9-8 context and returns the
    decoded `u8`.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 36 (2026-06-07)

- §9.3.4.2 / Table 9-48 entries for the `cu_chroma_qp_offset_flag` /
  `cu_chroma_qp_offset_idx` transform-unit syntax pair land in the
  [`binarization`] module — the per-TU gate that swaps the picture's
  chroma-QP offset (`pps_cb_qp_offset`, `pps_cr_qp_offset`) for an
  entry from the PPS-signalled `cb_qp_offset_list[ ]` /
  `cr_qp_offset_list[ ]` (§7.3.8.11, §7.4.9.10). Both elements have a
  Table 9-48 row whose every context-coded bin column is
  `ctxInc = 0`: the flag is FL `cMax = 1` (one bin); the idx is TR
  `cMax = chroma_qp_offset_list_len_minus1`, `cRiceParam = 0`
  (binIdx 0..=4 — the §7.4.3.3.1 PPS u(3) field bounds the list
  length at 5).
  - [`binarization::CU_CHROMA_QP_OFFSET_FLAG_FL_CMAX`] — Table 9-43
    shape: `cMax = 1`.
  - [`binarization::CU_CHROMA_QP_OFFSET_FLAG_FL_NBITS`] — §9.3.3.5
    `Ceil(Log2(cMax + 1))` collapsed to the `cMax = 1` constant `1`.
  - [`binarization::cu_chroma_qp_offset_flag_ctx_inc`] — Table 9-48
    bin-0 row for the flag: `ctxInc = 0` (Table 9-34 ctxIdx bank).
  - [`binarization::cu_chroma_qp_offset_idx_ctx_inc`] — Table 9-48
    row for every context-coded bin (binIdx 0..=4) of the TR prefix
    of the idx: `ctxInc = 0` (Table 9-35 ctxIdx bank).
  - [`binarization::cu_chroma_qp_offset_idx_tr_cmax`] — Table 9-43
    cMax pass-through: `cMax = chroma_qp_offset_list_len_minus1`.
  - [`binarization::CuChromaQpOffset`] — typed `(flag, idx)` pair
    with `offset_indices()` surfacing the §7.4.9.10 dereference gate
    (`flag == 0` ⇒ no list dereference; `flag == 1` ⇒ index 0 when
    the idx is not signalled per the cMax == 0 fast path).
  - [`binarization::decode_cu_chroma_qp_offset`] — engine-driven
    decode primitive that reads the FL flag bin, then (when the
    flag is 1 and the list has more than one entry) the TR prefix
    of the idx, returning the typed pair.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 35 (2026-06-07)

- §9.3.4.2 / Table 9-48 `coeff_sign_flag[ n ]` derivation lands in
  the [`binarization`] module — the per-scan-position sign bit that
  pairs with the round-34 `coeff_abs_level_remaining[ n ]` magnitude
  to form the signed transform-coefficient level per §7.4.9.11. The
  element is fully bypass-coded (Table 9-48 marks bin 0 `bypass`, all
  later bin-index columns `na`) and FL binarized with `cMax = 1`
  (Table 9-43), so the on-wire string is exactly one bin per
  invocation.
  - [`binarization::COEFF_SIGN_FLAG_FL_CMAX`] — Table 9-43 shape:
    `cMax = 1`.
  - [`binarization::COEFF_SIGN_FLAG_FL_NBITS`] — §9.3.3.5
    `fixedLength = Ceil(Log2(cMax + 1))` collapsed to the
    `cMax = 1` constant `1`.
  - [`binarization::decode_coeff_sign_flag`] — reads one
    [`CabacEngine::decode_bypass`] bin from the
    post-§9.3.4.3.6-alignment engine state and returns the
    per-scan-position sign bit (`0` ⇒ positive, `1` ⇒ negative per
    §7.4.9.11).
  - [`binarization::signed_level_from_sign_flag`] — composes the
    §7.4.9.11 signed level via the `(1 − 2 * coeff_sign_flag[n])`
    factor: `sign_flag == 0 ⇒ +abs_level`, `sign_flag == 1 ⇒
    −abs_level`. Returns `i32` so the high-bit-depth `|level|` range
    up to `CoeffMax = (1 << 15) − 1` survives composition before the
    §7.4.9.11 / Annex A `[CoeffMin, CoeffMax]` clip.
- The §9.3.4.3.6 alignment process (`ivlCurrRange := 256`) remains
  a slice-data-loop scope responsibility — the per-flag entry point
  expects [`CabacEngine::align`] to have already been invoked at the
  start of the bypass-coded tail of the current transform block.
- Test count: 350 → 359 (+9 new `coeff_sign_flag` tests covering
  the Table 9-43 FL shape + §9.3.3.5 fixedLength derivation
  cross-check; positive-branch identity sweep (sign_flag = 0 across
  5 anchors `{0, 1, 7, 127, 32_767}`); negative-branch identity
  sweep (sign_flag = 1, same anchors); inverse-identity
  (`signed(abs, 0) + signed(abs, 1) == 0` across 9 levels including
  `0 / 1 / 2 / 5 / 17 / 42 / 255 / 1023 / 65535`); high-bit-depth
  `[CoeffMin, CoeffMax]` round-trip (16-bit `|level| = 32_768`
  recovers under sign_flag = 1); the bypass-bin zero-output anchor
  (post-`align()` all-zero stream ⇒ bin 0); the well-typed-output
  anchor (output always in `{0, 1}` regardless of stream contents);
  the wrapper-vs-direct-`decode_bypass` agreement across 8 bins of
  a `5a a5 3c c3` seed (the wrapper is exactly the underlying
  bypass primitive); and the §7.4.9.11 residual-loop composition
  table (`baseLevel ∈ {1, 2, 3}` × `remaining ∈ {0, 1, 5, 17}` ×
  `sign ∈ {0, 1}`, 10 anchors).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 34 (2026-06-05)

- §9.3.3.11 `coeff_abs_level_remaining[ n ]` Rice-adaptive
  binarization + bypass decode primitive lands in the
  [`binarization`] module (non-persistent path:
  `persistent_rice_adaptation_enabled_flag == 0`,
  `extended_precision_processing_flag == 0`):
  - [`binarization::coeff_abs_level_remaining_c_rice_param_eq_9_24`]
    — eq. 9-24, the per-coefficient `cRiceParam` adaptation:
    `Min(cLastRiceParam + (cLastAbsLevel > (3 << cLastRiceParam)
    ? 1 : 0), 4)`.
  - [`binarization::coeff_abs_level_remaining_c_max_eq_9_26`] —
    eq. 9-26, `cMax = 4 << cRiceParam`.
  - [`binarization::coeff_abs_level_remaining_prefix_val_eq_9_27`]
    — eq. 9-27, `prefixVal = Min(cMax, level)`.
  - [`binarization::coeff_abs_level_remaining_suffix_val_eq_9_28`]
    — eq. 9-28, `suffixVal = level − cMax`.
  - [`binarization::COEFF_ABS_LEVEL_REMAINING_TR_PREFIX_ESCAPE_LEN`]
    — the §9.3.3.2 TR-prefix length, constant 4 once eq. 9-26 is
    substituted.
  - [`binarization::decode_coeff_abs_level_remaining`] — the
    end-to-end driver that runs against the §9.3.4.3.4
    `CabacEngine` bypass stream.
  - [`binarization::decode_coeff_abs_level_remaining_with`] — the
    bin-source-driven core (the algorithm logic factored from the
    engine wrapper) so the §9.3.3.11 derivation can be exercised
    with a flat bin queue.
- §9.3.3.3 EGk decoder helper generalised to arbitrary `k`; the
  former `decode_eg_k0` is preserved as a named alias for the
  `cu_qp_delta_abs` / `palette_escape_val` `k = 0` callers.
- Test count: 331 → 350 (+19 new `coeff_abs_level_remaining` tests
  covering the eq.-9-24 initial state, no-bump-at-threshold across
  `cRiceParam ∈ {0..=4}`, the +1-above-threshold bump, saturation
  at 4, monotone-in-`cLastAbsLevel`; the eq.-9-26 anchor table; the
  §9.3.3.2 TR-prefix-length-is-4 invariant; the eq.-9-27 clamp at
  `cMax`; the eq.-9-28 subtract; the prefix + suffix round-trip
  recomposition across `r ∈ {0..=4}` and 13 level anchors; the
  bin-source decode on zero / short-prefix `r ∈ {0, 1, 2}` /
  escape-path `r = 0` with and without payload; the TR-only
  round-trip across the full 0..cMax range for `r ∈ {0..=4}`; the
  escape-path round-trip across 5 suffix-value anchors × 5 Rice
  parameters; and the engine-wrapper smoke test).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 33 (2026-06-04)

- §9.3.4.2.8 `palette_run_prefix` ctxInc derivation lands in the
  [`binarization`] module. The §7.3.8.13 palette-coding (SCC) syntax
  element that signals the unary part of a palette-run length now
  has its `ctxInc` mapped via two cases:
  - [`binarization::palette_run_prefix_ctx_inc_eq_9_63`] — eq. 9-63
    branch (`copy_above_palette_indices_flag == 0 && binIdx == 0`):
    `ctxInc = (palette_idx_idc < 1) ? 0 : ((palette_idx_idc < 3) ?
    1 : 2)`. Returns `{0, 1, 2}`.
  - [`binarization::PALETTE_RUN_PREFIX_CTX_IDX_MAP`] — Table 9-51
    `ctxIdxMap[copy_above_palette_indices_flag][binIdx]` verbatim
    for `binIdx ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}` when `copy_above == 0` (`3, 3, 4, 4`)
    and for `binIdx ∈ {0..=4}` when `copy_above == 1` (`5, 6, 6, 7,
    7`). The `copy_above == 0, binIdx == 0` cell is held as the
    sentinel [`binarization::PALETTE_RUN_PREFIX_EQ_9_63_DISPATCH`]
    because that cell dispatches to eq. 9-63 above.
  - [`binarization::palette_run_prefix_ctx_inc`] — the public entry
    point that dispatches both branches and returns
    `Option<u32>` (`None` ⇒ bypass, signalled when `binIdx >=
    PALETTE_RUN_PREFIX_FIRST_BYPASS_BIN_IDX = 5` per Table 9-51's
    ">4" column and Table 9-48).
- §9.3.3 / Table 9-43 `palette_run_prefix` binarization shape lands
  as [`binarization::palette_run_prefix_tr_cmax`]
  (`cMax = Floor(Log2(PaletteMaxRunMinus1)) + 1`, `cRiceParam = 0`;
  the degenerate `PaletteMaxRunMinus1 == 0` input collapses to a
  single-bin TR terminator).
- Test count: 317 → 331 (+14 new `palette_run_prefix` tests covering
  the eq.-9-63 three bands, both copy-above branches of Table 9-51,
  the ">4" bypass boundary, the `ctxInc ∈ 0..=7` Table 9-40
  context-bank invariant, the `palette_idx_idc`-irrelevance of the
  non-eq.-9-63 branch, the eq.-9-63 / Table 9-51 disjointness
  invariant, plus TR `cMax` anchors at the
  `Floor(Log2(x)) + 1` power-of-two boundaries up to `u32::MAX` and
  monotonicity in `PaletteMaxRunMinus1`).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 32 (2026-06-04)

- §9.3.4.2.5 `sig_coeff_flag` ctxInc derivation lands in the
  [`binarization`] module. The per-scan-position significance bin
  the §7.3.8.11 residual-coding loop emits before any greater-1 /
  greater-2 step routes through one of four spec branches:
  - [`binarization::sig_coeff_flag_sig_ctx_transform_skip`] — eq.
    9-40 fast path used when `transform_skip_context_enabled_flag`
    is 1 and either `transform_skip_flag[ x0 ][ y0 ][ cIdx ]` or
    `cu_transquant_bypass_flag` is 1. Returns
    `sigCtx = 42` (luma) / `sigCtx = 16` (chroma), position-
    independent.
  - [`binarization::sig_coeff_flag_sig_ctx_log2_2`] — eq. 9-41 for
    the `log2TrafoSize == 2` (4×4) TB case. Reads `sigCtx` from
    [`binarization::SIG_COEFF_FLAG_CTX_IDX_MAP_LOG2_TRAFO_SIZE_2`],
    the 16-entry Table 9-50 lookup
    `[0, 1, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8, 8]` indexed by
    `(yC << 2) + xC`.
  - [`binarization::sig_coeff_flag_sig_ctx_dc`] — eq. 9-42 for the
    `xC + yC == 0` DC coefficient on `log2TrafoSize > 2`. Starts
    `sigCtx` at 0 (the eq.-9-43..9-48 neighbour walk is skipped)
    then applies the eq.-9-49..9-53 colour / size / scan-order
    tail.
  - [`binarization::sig_coeff_flag_sig_ctx_general`] — equations
    9-43..9-53 for the general `log2 > 2`, `xC + yC > 0` case.
    Computes `prevCsbf` from the right / below sub-block-flag
    neighbours (edge-gated by `xS / yS < (1 << (log2TrafoSize − 2))
    − 1`), routes through one of equations 9-45 (`prevCsbf == 0`,
    `(xP + yP == 0) ? 2 : (xP + yP < 3) ? 1 : 0`), 9-46
    (`prevCsbf == 1`, `(yP == 0) ? 2 : (yP == 1) ? 1 : 0`), 9-47
    (`prevCsbf == 2`, `(xP == 0) ? 2 : (xP == 1) ? 1 : 0`), 9-48
    (`prevCsbf == 3`, `sigCtx = 2`), then applies the luma-vs-
    chroma tail (eq. 9-49 luma `(xS + yS > 0) → += 3`; eq. 9-50
    luma `log2 == 3` `(scan_idx == 0 ? 9 : 15)`; eq. 9-51 luma
    other-sizes `+= 21`; eq. 9-52 chroma `log2 == 3` `+= 9`; eq.
    9-53 chroma other-sizes `+= 12`).
  - [`binarization::sig_coeff_flag_ctx_inc_from_sig_ctx`] — eq.
    9-54 luma `ctxInc = sigCtx` / eq. 9-55 chroma
    `ctxInc = 27 + sigCtx`, the final per-component offset
    applied to whichever `sigCtx` derivation the caller dispatched.
  - [`binarization::SIG_COEFF_FLAG_FL_CMAX`] = 1 — the Table 9-43
    binarization shape (FL with one context-coded bin per scan
    position).
- Total tests now 317 (was 294). 23 new tests cover: Table 9-50
  verbatim entries + entry-range invariant; eq. 9-40 luma 42 /
  chroma 16; eq. 9-41 at the (0, 0) DC position; the eq. 9-41

- §9.3.4.2.6 + §9.3.4.2.7 ctxInc derivations for the absolute-level
  greater-than-1 / greater-than-2 flags land in the
  [`binarization`] module. Both elements are Table 9-43 FL with
  `cMax = 1` (one context-coded bin per invocation), but the bin's
  `ctxInc` is driven by a small sub-block-scoped state machine
  (`ctxSet`, `greater1Ctx`, `lastGreater1Ctx`, `lastGreater1Flag`)
  that the §7.3.8.11 residual loop threads from sub-block to
  sub-block within the same transform block.
  - [`binarization::Greater1State`] — the §9.3.4.2.6 walker the
    slice parser carries across the residual sub-blocks of one
    transform block. Implements equations 9-56 (`i == 0 || cIdx > 0
    ⇒ ctxSet = 0`), 9-57 (luma `i > 0 ⇒ ctxSet = 2`), 9-58 (the
    `lastGreater1Ctx == 0 ⇒ ctxSet += 1` bump after the prior
    sub-block's greater-1-ladder mutation), and 9-59 (`ctxInc =
    (ctxSet * 4) + min(3, greater1Ctx)`) + 9-60 (chroma `+ 16`).
    Public step methods: [`Greater1State::new`],
    [`Greater1State::on_subblock_entry`] (start-of-sub-block init
    of `ctxSet` from `(i, is_chroma)` + prior sub-block's
    `last_greater1_flag`),
    [`Greater1State::on_coeff_abs_level_greater1_flag`] (per-bin
    step applying the `lastGreater1Flag = 1 → 0 / = 0 →
    increment-clamped-by-3` rule),
    [`Greater1State::current_ctx_inc`] (eq. 9-59 + 9-60 read for
    the next bin), and [`Greater1State::ctx_set`] (the §9.3.4.2.7
    read of the same sub-block's `ctxSet`).
  - [`binarization::coeff_abs_level_greater2_flag_ctx_inc`] —
    §9.3.4.2.7 eq. 9-61 / 9-62 `ctxInc = ctxSet` for luma /
    `ctxInc = ctxSet + 4` for chroma. Reads the §9.3.4.2.6 walker's
    current `ctxSet` (the per-sub-block value, not the post-update
    one) via [`Greater1State::ctx_set`].
  - [`binarization::COEFF_ABS_LEVEL_GREATER_X_FL_CMAX`] — Table 9-43
    binarization shape constant `= 1` (one context-coded bin per
    invocation of either flag).
- Total tests now 294 (was 280). 14 new tests cover: the
  first-sub-block init (eq.-9-56 `i == 0 ⇒ ctxSet = 0`,
  `greater1Ctx = 1`, luma first-bin `ctxInc = 1` and chroma `+ 16`);
  eq.-9-57 luma `i > 0 ⇒ ctxSet = 2`; eq.-9-56 chroma always-zero
  across `i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 5, 7}`; the per-bin step
  `lastGreater1Flag = 1 ⇒ greater1Ctx = 0` and `= 0 ⇒
  increment-clamped-at-3`, plus the "once at 0, the guard skips
  later updates" invariant; eq.-9-58 non-bump path (prior sub-block
  decoded a `0`-flag, `lastGreater1Ctx` mutates to a positive
  value, ctxSet stays at eq.-9-57's 2); eq.-9-58 bump path (prior
  sub-block ended at `greater1Ctx = 0`, `lastGreater1Ctx` stays 0,
  ctxSet bumps from 2 to 3); chroma `ctxInc + 16` with eq.-9-58
  bump (chroma starts at 0, bumps to 1, chroma `ctxInc = 1 * 4 + 1
  + 16 = 21`); the eq.-9-59 `Min(3, …)` clamp; eq.-9-61 luma
  identity across `ctxSet ∈ {0..=3}`; eq.-9-62 chroma `+ 4` across
  `ctxSet ∈ {0..=3}`; an end-to-end composition showing
  `coeff_abs_level_greater2_flag_ctx_inc(s.ctx_set(), …)` reads the
  same sub-block's ctxSet as the walker holds; and the FL `cMax = 1`
  shape assertion.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 30 (2026-06-03)

- §9.3.4.2 / Table 9-48 + §9.3.3 / Table 9-43 derivations for the
  §7.3.4 `sao()` per-CTU syntax-element family land in the
  [`binarization`] module. Every element is either a single
  context-coded bin-0 followed by zero or more bypass-coded bins or
  is fully bypass-coded; no neighbour-table walk is needed at this
  layer. The new public surface:
  - [`binarization::sao_merge_flag_ctx_inc`] — Table 9-48 row for
    `sao_merge_left_flag` and `sao_merge_up_flag`: bin 0
    `ctxInc = 0`. Both merge flags share the Table 9-5 context
    bank (single ctxIdx per initType) per Table 9-4.
    [`binarization::SAO_MERGE_FLAG_FL_CMAX`] = 1 captures the FL
    binarization (single bin) from Table 9-43.
  - [`binarization::sao_type_idx_ctx_inc`] — Table 9-48 row for
    `sao_type_idx_luma` and `sao_type_idx_chroma`: bin 0
    `ctxInc = 0`; bin 1 is bypass per Table 9-48 (not routed
    through a context). The TR(`cMax = 2`, `cRiceParam = 0`)
    binarization caps the prefix at two bins, encoding the §7.4.9.3
    `SaoTypeIdx ∈ {0, 1, 2}` (NOT_APPLIED / BAND / EDGE). The two
    variants share the Table 9-6 context bank per Table 9-4.
    [`binarization::SAO_TYPE_IDX_TR_CMAX`] = 2.
  - [`binarization::sao_offset_abs_tr_cmax`] — Table 9-43 row for
    `sao_offset_abs[ ][ ][ ][ ]`:
    `cMax = (1 << min(bitDepth, 10) − 5) − 1` (Min-clamped to 10 by
    the spec to keep the offset range bounded). All bins of the
    TR(`cRiceParam = 0`) prefix are bypass-coded per Table 9-48.
    bitDepth = 8 → 7; bitDepth = 9 → 15; bitDepth >= 10 → 31.
  - [`binarization::SAO_OFFSET_SIGN_FL_CMAX`] = 1,
    [`binarization::SAO_BAND_POSITION_FL_CMAX`] = 31 +
    [`binarization::SAO_BAND_POSITION_FL_NBITS`] = 5, and
    [`binarization::SAO_EO_CLASS_FL_CMAX`] = 3 +
    [`binarization::SAO_EO_CLASS_FL_NBITS`] = 2 — the Table 9-43
    FL-binarization shapes for the three fully-bypass elements
    (`sao_offset_sign`, `sao_band_position`, `sao_eo_class_{luma,
    chroma}`).
- Eleven new binarization tests cover the SAO row (269 → 280
  total): merge-flag ctxInc identity + FL cMax = 1; type-idx
  bin-0 ctxInc + TR cMax = 2; offset-sign FL cMax = 1;
  band-position FL cMax = 31 + 5-bit consistency; eo-class FL
  cMax = 3 + 2-bit consistency; offset-abs cMax derivation at
  8-bit (7), 9-bit (15), 10-bit (31), and the Min-clamp behaviour
  at 11/12/16-bit (all 31); offset-abs monotonicity in bitDepth.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 29 (2026-06-03)

- §7.3.2.2.1 SPS extension-flag block now decodes typed: when
  `sps_extension_present_flag == 1` the eight bits of the typed
  block are decoded into a new [`sps::SpsExtensionFlags`] struct
  carrying `sps_range_extension_flag` (§A.3.5 RExt-profile entry
  point), `sps_multilayer_extension_flag` (Annex F),
  `sps_3d_extension_flag` (Annex I), `sps_scc_extension_flag`
  (§A.3.7 Screen Content Coding profiles family), and the
  reserved-for-future-use `sps_extension_4bits` group. The opaque
  tail now starts at the first signalled extension body
  (`sps_range_extension()` / `sps_multilayer_extension()` /
  `sps_3d_extension()` / `sps_scc_extension()`) or at the
  `sps_extension_data_flag` while-loop when only
  `sps_extension_4bits` is non-zero. When every flag in the typed
  block is 0 the SPS ends cleanly without an opaque tail (only
  `rbsp_trailing_bits()` follows). [`sps::SpsExtensionFlags`] is
  re-exported from the crate root alongside the existing
  [`SeqParameterSet`] surface; it mirrors the same shape adopted
  for [`pps::PpsExtensionFlags`] in round 25, so RExt / SCC profile
  detection now reads the same way from both parameter sets.
- Four new SPS unit tests cover the typed block end-to-end (265 →
  269 total, plus two pre-existing opaque-tail tests rewritten to
  match the typed contract):
  - `captures_extension_opaque_tail` — single-flag set
    (`sps_range_extension_flag = 1`) lands the
    `sps_range_extension()` body in the opaque tail at the right
    bit position; the four typed flags + `sps_extension_4bits` are
    asserted.
  - `decodes_extension_flag_block_without_bodies` — typed block with
    every flag 0 decodes cleanly, [`SpsExtensionFlags::has_body`]
    returns false, and no opaque tail is surfaced.
  - `captures_scc_extension_opaque_tail` — single-flag set
    (`sps_scc_extension_flag = 1`) selects the §A.3.7 SCC profile
    family; the typed block decodes and `sps_scc_extension()`
    lands in the opaque tail.
  - `captures_extension_data_flag_tail_when_4bits_nonzero` —
    typed flags all 0 with `sps_extension_4bits = 1` still
    surfaces an opaque tail (the §7.3.2.2.1
    `while( more_rbsp_data() ) sps_extension_data_flag` block).
  - `extension_flags_absent_when_gate_zero` — gate 0 leaves
    `extension_flags = None` and no opaque tail.
  - `decodes_vui_then_captures_extension_tail` (rewritten) now
    drives the typed block through the VUI-present path with
    `sps_range_extension_flag = 1` instead of stuffing the eight
    "typed-flag bits" into the opaque tail.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 28 (2026-06-02)

- Six more §9.3.4.2 / Table 9-48 closed-form `ctxInc` derivations
  land in the [`binarization`] module. Each is a pure function of
  parameters the slice-data parser already has in hand (no
  neighbour-table walk, no CABAC engine drive at this layer):
  - `split_transform_flag[ ][ ][ ]` (§7.3.8.10 / §7.4.9.10) per
    Table 9-48: [`binarization::split_transform_flag_ctx_inc`]
    returns `ctxInc = 5 − log2TrafoSize` for the legal residual-
    quadtree TB sizes `log2TrafoSize ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5}`, mapping into
    the four-context bank `{0, 1, 2, 3}`.
  - `cbf_luma[ ][ ][ ]` (§7.3.8.10 / §7.4.9.10) per Table 9-48:
    [`binarization::cbf_luma_ctx_inc`] returns
    `ctxInc = (trafoDepth == 0) ? 1 : 0`, mapping into the two-
    context bank `{0, 1}` (root of the residual quadtree on ctx 1,
    deeper depths on ctx 0).
  - `cbf_cb[ ][ ][ ]` and `cbf_cr[ ][ ][ ]` (§7.3.8.10 / §7.4.9.10)
    per Table 9-48: [`binarization::cbf_cb_ctx_inc`] and
    [`binarization::cbf_cr_ctx_inc`] both return
    `ctxInc = trafoDepth` (the shared
    [`binarization::cbf_chroma_ctx_inc`] helper). Cb and Cr each
    have their own `ctxIdxOffset` (Table 9-4); this layer hands
    back the bank-relative `ctxInc` only.
  - `inter_pred_idc[ x0 ][ y0 ]` (§7.3.8.6 / §7.4.9.6) per Table
    9-48: [`binarization::inter_pred_idc_ctx_inc`] returns bin 0
    `ctxInc = (nPbW + nPbH != 12) ? CtDepth[x0][y0] : 4` and bin 1
    `ctxInc = 4`. The `nPbW + nPbH == 12` condition picks out the
    8×4 and 4×8 PUs (luma area 16 samples), which are encoded with
    the bin-0 escape onto the bin-1 context bank.
  - `log2_res_scale_abs_plus1[ c ]` (§7.3.8.13 / §7.4.9.13) per
    Table 9-48:
    [`binarization::log2_res_scale_abs_plus1_ctx_inc`] returns
    `ctxInc = 4*c + binIdx` for `binIdx ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}` and
    `c ∈ {0, 1}` (Cb / Cr), mapping into per-component banks
    `{0, 1, 2, 3}` and `{4, 5, 6, 7}` of the TR(`cMax = 4`) prefix.
  - `res_scale_sign_flag[ c ]` (§7.3.8.13 / §7.4.9.13) per Table
    9-48: [`binarization::res_scale_sign_flag_ctx_inc`] returns
    `ctxInc = c`, one bit per chroma component each on its own
    context.
- 14 new binarization unit tests (251 → 265 total): Table 9-48 row
  for `split_transform_flag` across log2TrafoSize 2..=5 plus the
  `ctxInc <= 3` bank-bound sweep; `cbf_luma` Table 9-48 row across
  trafoDepth 0..=4 plus the `ctxInc <= 1` bank-bound sweep; shared
  `cbf_chroma_ctx_inc` identity across trafoDepth 0..=4 and the
  Cb/Cr agreement check; `inter_pred_idc` bin 0 with `CtDepth`
  routing (64×64, 16×16 at depth 2, 8×8 at depth 3), bin 0 escape
  on the 8×4 / 4×8 16-sample PUs, bin 1 constant `ctxInc = 4`, and
  the `ctxInc ∈ {0..=4}` bank-bound sweep across eight PU shapes
  and four CtDepths; `log2_res_scale_abs_plus1` Cb bank and Cr bank
  identities (`4*c + binIdx`) plus the Cb/Cr disjoint-bank
  invariant; `res_scale_sign_flag` two-row identity.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 27 (2026-06-01)

- Three more §9.3.4.2 ctxInc derivations land in the
  [`binarization`] module, all pure-functional given their neighbour /
  sub-block context (no CABAC engine drive at this layer — callers
  compose the engine call themselves):
  - `coded_sub_block_flag` (§7.3.8.11 / §7.4.9.11) per §9.3.4.2.4
    equations 9-35..9-39:
    [`binarization::coded_sub_block_flag_ctx_inc`] takes
    `(is_chroma, right_neighbour, below_neighbour)` and returns
    `ctxInc = Min(csbfCtx, 1)` for luma (bank `{0, 1}`, equation 9-38)
    or `2 + Min(csbfCtx, 1)` for chroma (bank `{2, 3}`, equation
    9-39), where `csbfCtx` is the unsigned sum of the two previously
    decoded sub-block-flag neighbours.
    [`binarization::coded_sub_block_flag_ctx_inc_with_edge`] applies
    the equation 9-36 / 9-37 edge gates `xS < (1 << (log2TrafoSize −
    2)) − 1` / `yS < (1 << (log2TrafoSize − 2)) − 1` (the right /
    bottom sub-block-edge zero-outs) before delegating.
  - `split_cu_flag` (§7.3.8.4 / §7.4.9.4) and `cu_skip_flag` (§7.3.8.5 /
    §7.4.9.5) ctxInc derivations per §9.3.4.2.2 Table 9-49:
    [`binarization::left_above_ctx_inc`] implements the shared row
    shape `ctxInc = (condL && availableL) + (condA && availableA)`;
    [`binarization::split_cu_flag_cond`] returns the `split_cu_flag`
    per-neighbour predicate `CtDepth[xNb][yNb] > cqtDepth`;
    [`binarization::cu_skip_flag_cond`] returns the `cu_skip_flag`
    per-neighbour predicate `cu_skip_flag[xNb][yNb]`; the two row
    specialisations [`binarization::split_cu_flag_ctx_inc`] and
    [`binarization::cu_skip_flag_ctx_inc`] compose the per-neighbour
    cond with the availability AND and produce `ctxInc ∈ {0, 1, 2}`
    directly. Both row specialisations honour the §6.4.1 availability
    contract: an unavailable neighbour contributes 0 to `ctxInc` even
    when its cond would otherwise be true.
- 17 new binarization unit tests (234 → 251 total): §9.3.4.2.4 luma
  no-neighbours / one-neighbour / both-neighbours `Min` clamp; chroma
  `+2` offset across the same four input combinations; high-bit-mask
  defensive input; with-edge gating at 4×4 / 8×8 / 16×16 / 32×32 TBs
  (right and bottom edges drop their neighbours, luma + chroma); the
  §9.3.4.2.2 `(condL && availableL) + (condA && availableA)` truth
  table; the unavailability zero-out branch; `split_cu_flag_cond`
  strict-inequality table; `cu_skip_flag_cond` LSB-mask; four-way
  `split_cu_flag_ctx_inc` table (both deeper / left deeper / left
  unavailable / both unavailable); eight-way `cu_skip_flag_ctx_inc`
  truth table; and a bounded `ctxInc ∈ {0, 1, 2}` invariant sweep
  over a small Cartesian product of inputs.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 26 (2026-05-31)

- New [`binarization`] module implementing the §9.3.4.2
  per-syntax-element binarization + context-index derivation layer for
  the two CABAC elements unblocked by the clean-room trace
  `docs/video/h265/fixtures/main-422-10bit/cabac-cu-qp-delta-last-sig-trace.md`:
  - `cu_qp_delta_abs` / `cu_qp_delta_sign_flag` (§7.3.8.14 / §7.4.9.14)
    via [`binarization::decode_cu_qp_delta`] and the per-bin ctxInc
    table [`binarization::cu_qp_delta_abs_ctx_inc`] (Table 9-32: bin 0
    → ctx 0, bins 1..=4 → ctx 1). Binarization is §9.3.3.10 TR with
    `cMax = 5`, `cRiceParam = 0`, followed by an EGk(k=0) suffix when
    the prefix is the all-ones escape, plus the bypass-coded sign
    flag. The decoded [`binarization::CuQpDelta`] surfaces the
    §7.4.9.14 `CuQpDeltaVal = cu_qp_delta_abs * (1 − 2 *
    cu_qp_delta_sign_flag)` derivation.
  - `last_sig_coeff_{x,y}_{prefix,suffix}` (§7.3.8.11 / §7.4.9.11) via
    [`binarization::decode_last_sig_coeff`] plus the
    [`binarization::last_sig_coeff_prefix_ctx_offset_shift`] derivation
    (§9.3.4.2.3 luma `ctxOffset = 3*(log2TrafoSize − 2) + ((log2TrafoSize
    − 1) >> 2)`, `ctxShift = (log2TrafoSize + 1) >> 2`; chroma
    `ctxOffset = 15`, `ctxShift = log2TrafoSize − 2`) and
    [`binarization::last_sig_coeff_prefix_ctx_inc`] (`ctxInc =
    (binIdx >> ctxShift) + ctxOffset`). The prefix `cMax =
    (log2TrafoSize << 1) − 1` ([`binarization::last_sig_coeff_prefix_cmax`])
    bounds the TR length; the suffix is a `nBits = (prefix >> 1) − 1`
    bypass-coded fixed-length field present only when `prefix > 3`
    ([`binarization::last_sig_coeff_suffix_n_bits`]). The §7.4.9.11
    equations 7-74..7-77 position derivation lives in
    [`binarization::last_sig_coeff_position`], returning
    `LastSignificantCoeff{X,Y}` from `(prefix, optional suffix)`
    pre-scanIdx-2 swap. A [`binarization::LastSigCoeffBank`] tag (X / Y)
    is exposed for caller-side context-bank routing.
- §9.3.3.10 TR-prefix and §9.3.3.11 EGk(k=0) helpers ship as internal
  building blocks; the module sits one layer above the §9.3 arithmetic
  engine ([`cabac::CabacEngine`], round 11) and consumes context
  variables ([`cabac::ContextModel`]) supplied by the caller (the
  slice-data parser, when it lands).
- 16 new binarization unit tests (218 → 234 total): cu_qp_delta ctxInc
  table (Table 9-32 spot-check); last_sig_coeff offset/shift for luma
  log2 = 2..=5; same for chroma; ctxInc-from-binIdx parametrised over
  the 32×32-luma and 4×4-luma rows; `cMax` per log2 size; equation
  7-74 position derivation across the trace-observed luma 32×32 (px=6,
  LastX=8) + 16×16 chroma rows; suffix-nBits table; TR-prefix
  terminator and all-ones escape; cu_qp_delta_abs = 0 path (no sign
  flag, value = 0); §7.4.9.14 signed-value derivation over the 10
  multi-slice-per-frame trace rows; EGk(k=0) decoding driven through
  a crafted engine offset.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 25 (2026-05-30)

- §7.3.2.3.1 PPS extension-flag block: new typed
  [`pps::PpsExtensionFlags`] sub-struct exposing
  `pps_range_extension_flag`, `pps_multilayer_extension_flag`,
  `pps_3d_extension_flag`, `pps_scc_extension_flag`, and
  `pps_extension_4bits` decoded from the eight bits that follow
  `pps_extension_present_flag == 1`. The new
  [`PicParameterSet::extension_flags`] field carries it (an
  `Option<PpsExtensionFlags>`; `None` when the gate is absent, every
  flag inferred to 0 per §7.4.3.3.1).
- [`PpsExtensionFlags::has_body`] predicate — true when at least one
  of the four extension flags is set or `pps_extension_4bits != 0`
  (i.e. when an extension body follows in the bit stream and the PPS
  therefore carries an opaque tail starting at the first body's bit
  position).
- Opaque-tail capture for the PPS now starts at the first signalled
  extension body's bit position rather than at the
  `pps_extension_present_flag` boundary; when every flag is zero the
  tail is `None` because only `rbsp_trailing_bits()` remain (consumed
  implicitly). The individual extension-body syntax structures
  (`pps_range_extension()` §7.3.2.3.2, `pps_multilayer_extension()`
  Annex F, `pps_3d_extension()` Annex I, `pps_scc_extension()`, and
  the `pps_extension_data_flag` while-loop) remain inside the opaque
  tail and are not yet decoded.
- Tests: four new pps tests
  (`decodes_extension_flag_block_without_bodies`,
  `captures_range_extension_opaque_tail`,
  `captures_extension_data_flag_tail_when_4bits_nonzero`,
  `extension_flags_absent_when_gate_zero`). The prior
  `captures_extension_opaque_tail` is replaced by the
  no-body-flag-block test since the all-zero flag block no longer
  surfaces an opaque tail. Total test count 218 (was 215).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 24 (2026-05-30)

- §7.4.8 inter-RPS-prediction derivation as the new typed builder
  [`ShortTermRefPicSet::materialize`] and the post-derivation form
  [`MaterializedShortTermRefPicSet`]. The explicit-form branch
  implements equations 7-63..7-70: `NumNegativePics =
  num_negative_pics`, `NumPositivePics = num_positive_pics`,
  `UsedByCurrPicS{0,1}[i] = used_by_curr_pic_s{0,1}_flag[i]`, and the
  cumulative `DeltaPocS0[i] = DeltaPocS0[i-1] - (delta_poc_s0_minus1[i]
  + 1)` / `DeltaPocS1[i] = DeltaPocS1[i-1] +
  (delta_poc_s1_minus1[i] + 1)` recurrences with the equation-7-67 /
  7-68 first-element seeds. The inter-RPS-prediction branch implements
  equations 7-60 (`deltaRps = (1 - 2*delta_rps_sign) *
  (abs_delta_rps_minus1 + 1)`), 7-61 (negative-side reconstruction —
  source-positives in reverse, optional `deltaRps` self-term when
  negative, then source-negatives in forward order), and 7-62
  (positive-side, mirrored), running each surviving entry through its
  `use_delta_flag[j]` gate. The per-position
  `used_by_curr_pic_flag` / `use_delta_flag` array lengths are checked
  against the source RPS's `NumDeltaPocs[RefRpsIdx] + 1` and a
  mismatch raises
  [`ShortTermRefPicSetMaterializeError::SourceLengthMismatch`]; an
  absent source for an inter-form RPS raises
  [`ShortTermRefPicSetMaterializeError::MissingSource`].
- [`SeqParameterSet::materialize_short_term_ref_pic_sets`] runs the
  full SPS-level chain, materialising each entry in order and feeding
  inter-form entries their source from prior materialised entries via
  the equation-7-59 `RefRpsIdx = stRpsIdx - (delta_idx_minus1 + 1)`
  lookup. The output is exposed as
  `Vec<MaterializedShortTermRefPicSet>` aligned 1:1 with the
  SPS-resident `short_term_ref_pic_sets[]`.
- §7.3.6.1 slice parser: the previously-deferred SPS / inline
  inter-RPS-prediction branch at the `ref_pic_lists_modification()`
  gate now resolves through the new derivation. The slice parser
  materialises the SPS list once, picks the active RPS (inline source
  via `RefRpsIdx = num_short_term_ref_pic_sets - (delta_idx_minus1 +
  1)` for the inline-inter case), feeds the derived
  `UsedByCurrPicS{0,1}` slices into
  [`NumPicTotalCurrInputs::from_used_flags`] / `compute`, and then
  walks the in-place RPLM gate exactly as the explicit-form path did
  in round 23. Configurations whose materialisation succeeds reach
  `byte_alignment()` end to end; only malformed inter-form chains
  (e.g. on-wire `used_by_curr_pic_flag` length not matching the
  source's `NumDeltaPocs + 1`) defer to an opaque tail at the RPLM
  bit. With this round the only remaining parser-side §7.3.6.1
  deferral is the malformed-inter-RPS-prediction fallback; every
  conformant non-IDR P / B slice — explicit or inter-form short-term
  RPS — parses end to end through `byte_alignment()`.
- New unit tests (5 in `sps`, 1 in `slice`; total 215, was 208):
  `materialize_explicit_form_recurrence` (equations 7-67..7-70 with a
  three-negative / two-positive RPS),
  `materialize_inter_rps_prediction_matches_fixture` (re-uses the
  existing `parses_inter_rps_prediction` wire fixture with a hand-
  traced expected output),
  `materialize_inter_rps_prediction_negative_delta_rps` (deltaRps =
  -2 with a single source positive — exercises the negative-side
  source-positives-reverse + deltaRps-self-term branches of equation
  7-61), `materialize_inter_rps_rejects_missing_source` and
  `materialize_inter_rps_rejects_length_mismatch`,
  `sps_materialize_chains_inter_rps_prediction` (SPS-level chain on
  the same fixture verifying both entries materialise correctly), and
  `parses_p_slice_with_sps_inter_predicted_rps_npc_le_1` (slice-level
  test exercising the new wiring: a P-slice with an SPS-form
  inter-predicted RPS materialises, `NumPicTotalCurr == 0` makes the
  RPLM gate statically false, and the parser walks the inter-slice
  tail to `byte_alignment()` without surfacing an opaque tail). The
  pre-round `defers_rplm_when_active_st_rps_uses_inter_prediction`
  test is preserved with an updated header that describes the
  malformed-array defer path more precisely.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 23 (2026-05-29)

- §7.3.6.2 `ref_pic_lists_modification()` decoded **in place** at the
  §7.3.6.1 slice-header call site when the §7.4.7.2 `NumPicTotalCurr`
  derivation can be resolved without running the §7.4.8
  inter-RPS-prediction step. The wiring covers two configurations:
  * inline-form short-term RPS (`short_term_ref_pic_set_sps_flag ==
    0`) — per §7.4.8, at `stRpsIdx == num_short_term_ref_pic_sets` the
    `inter_ref_pic_set_prediction_flag` is signalled only when
    `num_short_term_ref_pic_sets > 0`; when it is `0` (or signalled
    `0`) the per-position `used_by_curr_pic_s{0,1}_flag` arrays are
    consumed directly by equation 7-57;
  * SPS-form short-term RPS (`short_term_ref_pic_set_sps_flag == 1`)
    whose picked entry has `inter_ref_pic_set_prediction_flag == 0`
    — the SPS-resident explicit arrays are likewise consumed
    directly.
  The §7.4.7.1 long-term-block resolver
  (`SliceLongTermRefPic::used_by_curr_pic_lt`, round 14) supplies the
  `UsedByCurrPicLt[i]` slice. When `NumPicTotalCurr > 1` the parser
  calls the standalone `RefPicListsModification::parse` (round 15)
  and exposes the result as
  `SliceSegmentHeader::ref_pic_lists_modification` (an
  `Option<RefPicListsModification>`); when `NumPicTotalCurr <= 1` the
  §7.3.6.1 gate is statically false and the parser skips the structure
  and continues into the mvd / cabac-init / collocated block. The
  active short-term RPS in inter-RPS-predicted form still defers — the
  §7.4.8 derivation chain is the next blocker — and the opaque tail
  in that case begins at the `ref_pic_lists_modification()` bit
  position.
- New unit tests covering the new wiring:
  `parses_rplm_in_place_with_explicit_inline_rps_npc_two` (inline
  explicit RPS with `NumPicTotalCurr == 2`, RPLM decoded in place
  with one `list_entry_l0` entry one bit wide),
  `skips_rplm_when_num_pic_total_curr_is_one` (inline explicit RPS
  with `NumPicTotalCurr == 1`, gate statically false, RPLM skipped),
  `defers_rplm_when_active_st_rps_uses_inter_prediction` (SPS-form
  RPS with `inter_ref_pic_set_prediction_flag == 1`, opaque tail
  retained), and an updated
  `skips_rplm_when_num_pic_total_curr_is_zero_idr` that replaces the
  pre-round defer-on-flag test (an IDR slice with
  `lists_modification_present_flag == 1` now walks the full inter
  tail because the non-IDR POC/RPS block is absent and
  `NumPicTotalCurr == 0`).
- New field `SliceSegmentHeader::ref_pic_lists_modification:
  Option<RefPicListsModification>`. `None` for I slices, dependent
  slice segments, headers whose parse stopped before this point, the
  inter-RPS-predicted defer case, and the statically-false-gate case
  (`NumPicTotalCurr <= 1` or `pps.lists_modification_present_flag ==
  0`).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 22 (2026-05-29)

- §7.3.6.1 entry-point-offset block: the slice-header parser now
  captures the per-i `entry_point_offset_minus1[i]` (`u(offset_len_minus1
  + 1)`) values into [`EntryPointOffsets::entry_point_offset_minus1`]
  (a `Vec<u32>`) instead of skipping them. The per-subset byte length
  of §7.4.7.1 (`entry_point_offset_minus1[i] + 1`) is exposed via
  [`EntryPointOffsets::subset_length`]. The struct loses its `Copy`
  bound (it now owns a `Vec`).
- §7.4.7.1 range check on `num_entry_point_offsets`: the on-wire value
  is now bounded by the active PPS partitioning
  (`NumTileColumns * NumTileRows − 1` for tiles, `PicHeightInCtbsY −
  1` for WPP, with the `tiles + WPP` combination — already barred by
  §7.4.3.3.1 — taking the wider of the two as a defensive cap). A
  breaching wire value raises a `ValueOutOfRange { field:
  "num_entry_point_offsets", got }` (`SliceError`).
- New unit tests: `parses_wpp_entry_point_offsets_in_place` (two
  per-row offsets `{6, 9}` captured verbatim, subset lengths
  `{7, 10}`), `parses_tiles_block_with_single_tile_no_offsets`
  (`num_entry_point_offsets == 0` honored when the §7.4.7.1 bound is
  0), `rejects_wpp_entry_point_offsets_above_pic_height_bound` (16×16
  WPP → bound 0, wire `1` rejected), `rejects_offset_len_minus1_above_31`
  (a wire codeNum 32 rejected).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 21 (2026-05-27)

- §7.3.6.3 `pred_weight_table()` decoded **in place** at the §7.3.6.1
  slice-header call site (closing the last r20 deferral point for the
  universal base-profile single-layer case). When the §7.3.6.1 outer
  gate is statically present
  (`(pps.weighted_pred_flag && slice_type == P)` or
  `(pps.weighted_bipred_flag && slice_type == B)`), the parser
  constructs a `PredWeightTableInputs::base_profile` from the
  post-override `num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1`, the SPS-derived
  `ChromaArrayType` (per §7.4.2.2: `chroma_format_idc` unless
  `separate_colour_plane_flag == 1`), and the SPS bit depths, then
  invokes the standalone [`PredWeightTable::parse`] (round 17) and
  continues through the rest of the inter-slice tail to
  `byte_alignment()`. The base-profile constructor treats every per-i
  §7.3.6.3 outer-gate decision
  (`pic_layer_id != nuh_layer_id ||
  PicOrderCnt(RefPicListX[i]) != PicOrderCnt(CurrPic)`) as `true`,
  which is the universal correct value for any single-layer slice:
  every active reference in a single-layer stream is an earlier-POC
  temporal picture (i.e. a different picture). The per-i gate slots
  stay open on `PredWeightTableInputs` for the eventual SCC
  self-reference / inter-layer ref-layer cases, which will be threaded
  through this call site once the SPS multilayer / SCC extensions are
  surfaced (currently they are surfaced as opaque tails). A new
  `SliceSegmentHeader::pred_weight_table: Option<PredWeightTable>`
  field exposes the decoded table (`None` for I slices, dependent
  slice segments, for headers whose parse stopped at a prior
  deferral, and when the gate is statically absent). §7.4.7.3 range
  failures inside the in-place parse propagate directly out of
  `SliceSegmentHeader::parse` as `SliceError::ValueOutOfRange`.

- With the in-place call site wired up, every weighted-pred-gated
  P / B independent slice segment in the crate's currently surfaced
  configuration (no SPS range / multilayer / SCC extensions) now
  parses end to end through `byte_alignment()`. The
  `SliceSegmentHeader::opaque_tail` deferral remains only for the
  `pps.lists_modification_present_flag == 1` path, where the
  §7.3.6.2 `ref_pic_lists_modification()` body still needs the
  §7.4.7.2 `NumPicTotalCurr` derivation threaded through the slice
  parser (the next round's target).

### Changed — clean-room rebuild round 21 (2026-05-27)

- The eight pre-round `slice::tests` units that exercised the
  post-override walk with `pps.weighted_pred_flag = true` or
  `pps.weighted_bipred_flag = true` are updated to consume their
  `pred_weight_table()` bodies in place (minimal "all flags off"
  payloads sized per the active `num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1`)
  and assert `opaque_tail.is_none()`. The deferred-at-PWT-gate
  scenario no longer exists for these tests.

- Three new `slice::tests` units cover the in-place behaviour: the
  universal base-profile P-slice walk with a non-trivial
  `delta_luma_weight_l0` (verifies the §7.4.7.3 derived
  `LumaWeightL0[0] = (1 << 2) + 5 = 9` via
  `PredWeightTable::luma_weight_l0`); a B-slice walk with an L1
  chroma sub-block + non-trivial `delta_chroma_weight_l1` /
  `delta_chroma_offset_l1` (verifies the equation 7-58
  `ChromaOffsetL1[0][j]` derivation with `WpOffsetHalfRangeC = 128`);
  and a `delta_luma_weight_l0 = 128` range-failure propagation test
  (the in-place call site surfaces the same
  `SliceError::ValueOutOfRange` as the standalone parser).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 20 (2026-05-27)

- §7.3.6.1 inter-slice `five_minus_max_num_merge_cand` (`ue(v)`) decoded
  in place when the §7.3.6.3 `pred_weight_table()` gate is statically
  absent, i.e. when neither `(pps.weighted_pred_flag && slice_type == P)`
  nor `(pps.weighted_bipred_flag && slice_type == B)` holds. The wire
  value is range-checked at 0..=4 (the derived `MaxNumMergeCand =
  5 - five_minus_max_num_merge_cand` must lie in 1..=5 per §7.4.7.1
  equation 7-53). A new `SliceSegmentHeader::five_minus_max_num_merge_cand`
  field surfaces the raw value, and a new `max_num_merge_cand()`
  accessor returns the derived value. The SCC `use_integer_mv_flag`
  (gated on `motion_vector_resolution_control_idc == 2`) is statically
  absent because the PPS SCC extension is not yet surfaced (§7.4.7.1:
  when not present, `motion_vector_resolution_control_idc` is inferred
  to 0). With the merge-candidate leaf landed and the SCC integer-MV
  bit statically absent, the parser now walks the entire inter-slice
  header through the shared I-slice tail — `slice_qp_delta` (`se(v)`),
  the chroma QP offsets, the deblocking override block, the
  loop-filter-across-slices flag, the entry-point-offset block, the
  slice-segment-header extension block, and `byte_alignment()` — and
  reports a non-`None` `byte_offset_to_slice_data`, with
  `opaque_tail == None`. When the weighted-pred gate IS statically
  present (either of the two conditions above holds), the parser keeps
  deferring at the gate, the four `mvd_l1_zero_flag` /
  `cabac_init_flag` / `collocated_from_l0_flag` / `collocated_ref_idx`
  fields stay populated as in round 19, and `opaque_tail` captures the
  bit position of the `pred_weight_table()` block. Three new
  `slice::tests` units cover the full P-slice walk through
  `byte_alignment()`, the full B-slice walk with temporal MVP +
  collocated_ref_idx, and the `five_minus_max_num_merge_cand > 4` range
  failure. The six pre-round inter-slice tests that exercised the
  mvd / cabac / collocated walk are updated to set
  `pps.weighted_pred_flag = true` (P) or `pps.weighted_bipred_flag =
  true` (B) so they continue to assert the defer-at-weighted-pred
  behaviour now that the no-weighted-pred path walks through.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 19 (2026-05-26)

- §7.3.6.1 inter-slice `mvd_l1_zero_flag` / `cabac_init_flag` /
  `collocated_from_l0_flag` / `collocated_ref_idx` block decoded
  in-place when `pps.lists_modification_present_flag == 0` (the
  outer `if(... && NumPicTotalCurr > 1)` short-circuit makes the
  `ref_pic_lists_modification()` block statically absent, so the
  DPB-derived §7.4.7.2 `NumPicTotalCurr` is not yet needed). Four
  new `Option`-typed fields on `SliceSegmentHeader` carry the
  values plus the §7.4.7.1 inferences:
  `mvd_l1_zero_flag` (B slices only); `cabac_init_flag` (signalled
  iff `pps.cabac_init_present_flag == 1`, else inferred `false`);
  `collocated_from_l0_flag` (signalled for B + `mvp`, else inferred
  `true` for P + `mvp`); `collocated_ref_idx` (signalled when the
  active list has > 1 entry, range-checked against
  `num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1`, else inferred `0`). The deferred
  P/B opaque tail now begins at the §7.3.6.1 weighted-pred-table
  gate (`pred_weight_table()` when `weighted_pred_flag` /
  `weighted_bipred_flag` applies). When
  `pps.lists_modification_present_flag == 1` the parser still
  defers at the `ref_pic_lists_modification()` gate (its
  `NumPicTotalCurr` derivation needs §7.4.8 inter-RPS-prediction
  resolution that this round does not wire in). Seven new
  `slice::tests` units cover the no-mvp B-slice mvd walk, the
  P-slice cabac-init walk, the P-slice mvp + inferred
  `collocated_from_l0_flag` paths (single-ref inferred `ref_idx`
  and multi-ref signalled `ref_idx`), the B-slice
  `collocated_from_l0_flag == 0` L1 path, the
  `collocated_ref_idx > num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1` range
  failure, and the `lists_modification_present_flag == 1` defer
  path. The pre-round `defers_pb_ref_list_body` test is updated
  to assert the §7.4.7.1 `cabac_init_flag` inference (`Some(false)`)
  and the absent-collocated state in addition to the existing
  opaque-tail bit position.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 18 (2026-05-26)

- §7.3.6.1 inter-slice prelude decoded in place: the
  `num_ref_idx_active_override_flag` `u(1)` and (when set) the
  `num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1` `ue(v)` and (B slices only)
  `num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1` `ue(v)` values now sit on the
  `SliceSegmentHeader` as three new `Option`-typed fields. The §7.4.7.1
  inference rule fills the per-list values from the PPS defaults when
  the override flag is 0; explicit values are range-checked at 0..=14.
  The deferred P/B opaque tail now begins immediately after the
  override block (at the `ref_pic_lists_modification()` gate when
  signalled, otherwise at `mvd_l1_zero_flag`), so a future round that
  threads the §7.3.6.2 + §7.4.7.2 + §7.3.6.3 pieces in place starts
  from the right bit position with the correct
  `num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1` values already in hand. Four new
  unit tests in `slice::tests` cover the inferred-defaults P-slice
  path, the explicit-L0-only P-slice path, the B-slice
  `[L0, L1]` explicit path, the B-slice inferred-defaults path, and
  the `num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 > 14` range failure. The pre-round
  `defers_pb_ref_list_body` test is rewritten to encode the new
  override = 0 bit and check the now-correct opaque-tail start.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 17 (2026-05-26)

- §7.3.6.3 `pred_weight_table()` syntax structure as a new standalone
  parser ([`slice::PredWeightTable`]). The parser takes a
  [`slice::PredWeightTableInputs`] descriptor carrying the active
  `slice_type`, the post-override `num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1`
  cardinalities, the SPS's `ChromaArrayType` + bit depths and the
  range-extension `high_precision_offsets_enabled_flag`, plus per-i
  override slices for the §7.3.6.3 outer-gate (`pic_layer_id !=
  nuh_layer_id || PicOrderCnt(RefPicListX[i]) != PicOrderCnt(CurrPic)`)
  decision. [`slice::PredWeightTableInputs::base_profile`] covers the
  common single-layer base-profile case (every gate `true`,
  `high_precision_offsets_enabled_flag == false`).
  [`slice::PredWeightTable::parse`] reads
  `luma_log2_weight_denom` (`ue(v)`, range 0..=7) and, when chroma is
  present, `delta_chroma_log2_weight_denom` (`se(v)`) with the derived
  `ChromaLog2WeightDenom ∈ 0..=7` range check; then performs the two
  flag passes (luma and chroma) and the per-reference delta block
  (`delta_luma_weight_lX[i]` ∈ −128..=127, `luma_offset_lX[i]` ∈
  `−WpOffsetHalfRangeY ..= WpOffsetHalfRangeY − 1`,
  `delta_chroma_weight_lX[i][j]` ∈ −128..=127,
  `delta_chroma_offset_lX[i][j]` ∈
  `−4 * WpOffsetHalfRangeC ..= 4 * WpOffsetHalfRangeC − 1`). For B
  slices the L1 block is mirrored after L0. The §7.4.7.3 conformance
  cap `sumWeightLXFlags ≤ 24` is enforced (P: L0 only; B: L0+L1).
  Accessor methods [`slice::PredWeightTable::luma_weight_l0`] (mirrored
  for L1), [`slice::PredWeightTable::chroma_weight_l0`] (mirrored) and
  [`slice::PredWeightTable::chroma_offset_l0`] (mirrored, equation
  7-58) apply the §7.4.7.3 derivations for `LumaWeightLX[i]`,
  `ChromaWeightLX[i][j]` and `ChromaOffsetLX[i][j]` (including the
  §7.4.7.3 inferred values when the per-i flag is `false`).
  [`slice::PredWeightEntry`] groups the per-reference syntax elements
  in their unresolved on-wire form for audit.
- Module-level documentation extended with a §7.3.6.3 bullet covering
  the new `PredWeightTable` parser, the per-i outer-gate threading and
  the §7.4.7.3 derived-variable accessors.
- 11 new unit tests covering: a monochrome (`ChromaArrayType == 0`)
  P-slice single-reference parse with `LumaWeightL0[0]` derivation, a
  4:2:0 P-slice single-reference parse with chroma derivations
  (including equation 7-58 `ChromaOffsetL0[0][j]`), a B-slice
  "all flags zero" minimal-content case with inferred derived
  variables, range failures for `luma_log2_weight_denom > 7`, derived
  `ChromaLog2WeightDenom > 7`, `delta_luma_weight_l0[i] > 127` and
  `luma_offset_l0[i] > 127` at 8-bit, an acceptance test for
  `luma_offset_l0[i] == 200` at `high_precision_offsets_enabled_flag
  == true` + `BitDepthY == 10`, an outer-gate suppression test that
  verifies the gated-off luma-flag bit is not consumed and the
  delta is inferred to 0, a precondition test rejecting an
  `signal_luma_l0` slice with the wrong length, an I-slice rejection
  test, and a `sumWeightL0Flags > 24` conformance test.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 16 (2026-05-26)

- §7.4.7.2 `NumPicTotalCurr` derivation (equation 7-57) as a new
  typed builder ([`slice::NumPicTotalCurrInputs`]):
  - [`slice::NumPicTotalCurrInputs::from_used_flags`] takes
    pre-resolved per-position `UsedByCurrPicS0` / `UsedByCurrPicS1` /
    `UsedByCurrPicLt` slices; [`slice::NumPicTotalCurrInputs::compute`]
    returns the typed `NumPicTotalCurr: u32`.
  - [`slice::NumPicTotalCurrInputs::from_explicit_short_term_rps`]
    sources the `S0` / `S1` slices straight off an explicit-form
    [`sps::ShortTermRefPicSet`] (equations 7-65 / 7-66); returns
    `None` for inter-RPS-predicted RPS sets (the §7.4.8 derivation
    must run first).
  - Builder methods
    [`slice::NumPicTotalCurrInputs::with_pps_curr_pic_ref_enabled`]
    (the SCC PPS closing-clause flag — inferred `false` until the
    SCC PPS extension is materialised) and
    [`slice::NumPicTotalCurrInputs::with_multilayer_extension`]
    (the F.7.4.7.2 equation `F-56` form — IDR `nal_unit_type` skips
    the short-term / long-term loops; `NumActiveRefLayerPics` is
    added at the end).
- §7.4.7.1 long-term resolution helper
  ([`slice::SliceLongTermRefPic::used_by_curr_pic_lt`]) — looks up
  `used_by_curr_pic_lt_sps_flag[ lt_idx_sps[i] ]` for
  SPS-resident entries against `sps.long_term_ref_pics`, and returns
  `used_by_curr_pic_lt_flag[i]` for in-slice entries. Returns `None`
  when the SPS-table index is out of range (bitstream-conformance
  failure).
- Public re-export: [`slice::NumPicTotalCurrInputs`] added to the
  crate root.
- [`slice::SliceSegmentHeader::parse`] still surfaces the inter-slice
  tail as an opaque tail — the §7.3.6.1 in-place call site is now
  unblocked (round 15's `RefPicListsModification::parse` + this
  round's `NumPicTotalCurr` derivation are both in place) but the
  full inter-slice body parse (the `pred_weight_table()` + the
  remaining handful of post-RPS flags + the slice-data offset) is a
  separate round's worth of work.
- 12 spec-pinned unit tests:
  `num_pic_total_curr_short_term_only`,
  `num_pic_total_curr_mixed_short_and_long_term`,
  `num_pic_total_curr_curr_pic_ref_only`,
  `num_pic_total_curr_all_contributors`,
  `num_pic_total_curr_zero_when_nothing_contributes`,
  `num_pic_total_curr_from_explicit_rps_builder`,
  `num_pic_total_curr_from_explicit_rps_rejects_inter_prediction`,
  `used_by_curr_pic_lt_resolves_sps_table_and_in_slice`,
  `num_pic_total_curr_from_resolved_slice_long_term_list`,
  `num_pic_total_curr_multilayer_skips_temporal_loops_for_idr`,
  `num_pic_total_curr_multilayer_keeps_loops_for_non_idr`,
  `num_pic_total_curr_drives_section_7_3_6_1_gate`. Test count
  160 → 172.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 15 (2026-05-26)

- §7.3.6.2 `ref_pic_lists_modification()` syntax structure decoded by
  a new standalone parser ([`slice::RefPicListsModification::parse`]):
  - `ref_pic_list_modification_flag_l0` `u(1)` gate +
    `list_entry_l0[ 0 .. num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 ]` `u(v)` loop
    (each entry `Ceil( Log2( NumPicTotalCurr ) )` bits wide per
    §7.4.7.2) with each value range-checked to
    `0 ..= NumPicTotalCurr - 1`.
  - B-slice-gated `ref_pic_list_modification_flag_l1` `u(1)` +
    matching `list_entry_l1[ 0 .. num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 ]`
    `u(v)` loop (same width / range check).
  - Up-front precondition checks rejecting `SliceType::I` calls (the
    §7.3.6.1 gate sits inside the inter-slice branch),
    `NumPicTotalCurr <= 1` (the §7.3.6.1 gate guarantees `> 1` at the
    in-place call site), and `num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 > 14` (the
    §7.4.7.1 cap on the per-list active count).
- `slice::RefPicListsModification` re-exported from the crate root
  for downstream callers.
- `slice::SliceSegmentHeader::parse` still defers the in-place
  call: the §7.3.6.1 invocation `if( lists_modification_present_flag
  && NumPicTotalCurr > 1 ) ref_pic_lists_modification( )` is gated by
  the DPB-derived `NumPicTotalCurr` (§7.4.7.2), which is the next
  round's primitive. The standalone parser unblocks that round.
- 12 spec-pinned unit tests covering: P-slice L0-only and L0-implicit
  cases, B-slice both-lists and L0-implicit-L1-explicit and
  both-flags-zero cases, the `list_entry_lX > NumPicTotalCurr - 1`
  range checks for both L0 and L1, the `SliceType::I`,
  `NumPicTotalCurr <= 1`, and `num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 > 14`
  precondition rejections, the maximum-active-index (15-entry) case,
  a `Ceil( Log2( N ) )` per-entry width check across
  `N in { 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 16 }`, and a truncated-RBSP path.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 14 (2026-05-25)

- §E.2.1 `vui_parameters()` body decoded as a new `vui` module
  (`vui::VuiParameters`), replacing the opaque SPS VUI tail:
  - aspect-ratio info (`aspect_ratio_idc` `u(8)` + the `EXTENDED_SAR`
    `sar_width` / `sar_height` `u(16)` pair), overscan,
    `video_signal_type` (`video_format` / `video_full_range_flag` +
    the `ColourDescription` `colour_primaries` /
    `transfer_characteristics` / `matrix_coeffs` triple), chroma-loc
    info (`chroma_sample_loc_type_{top,bottom}_field` 0..=5
    range-checked), the neutral-chroma / field-seq / frame-field
    flags, the `DefaultDisplayWindow` offset quad.
  - `VuiTimingInfo`: `u(32)` `vui_num_units_in_tick` /
    `vui_time_scale` enforced `> 0` per §E.3.1, the POC-proportional
    flag + `vui_num_ticks_poc_diff_one_minus1`, and the nested §E.2.3
    `hrd_parameters( 1, sps_max_sub_layers_minus1 )` call reusing the
    existing `HrdParameters` parser.
  - `BitstreamRestriction` with the §E.3.1
    `min_spatial_segmentation_idc` 0..=4095, `max_bytes_per_pic_denom`
    / `max_bits_per_min_cu_denom` 0..=16, and
    `log2_max_mv_length_{horizontal,vertical}` 0..=15 range-checks.
- SPS RBSP parse now decodes the VUI body inline rather than
  capturing it as the opaque tail:
  - `SeqParameterSet::vui_parameters: Option<VuiParameters>` populated
    when `vui_parameters_present_flag == 1`; parsing then continues to
    `sps_extension_present_flag` in both paths.
  - `SeqParameterSet::opaque_tail` now populated only for the
    `sps_extension_present_flag == 1` extension payload +
    `rbsp_trailing_bits()` suffix.
  - `SpsError::Vui` variant added to surface `VuiError` failures while
    preserving the single-pattern `Truncated` handler.
- Public re-exports: `BitstreamRestriction`, `ColourDescription`,
  `DefaultDisplayWindow`, `VideoSignalType`, `VuiError`,
  `VuiParameters`, `VuiTimingInfo`, `EXTENDED_SAR` added to the crate
  root; `Error::Vui` variant added.
- Tests: 18 new `vui` per-field tests plus the SPS-level
  `decodes_vui_then_continues_to_extension_flag` /
  `decodes_vui_then_captures_extension_tail`; the tiny x265-encoded
  fixture test now asserts the decoded VUI (1:1 SAR, video_format 5,
  1/25 timing) instead of an opaque tail. Test count 130 → 146.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 13 (2026-05-25)

- §E.2.2 / §E.2.3 `hrd_parameters()` and `sub_layer_hrd_parameters()`
  bodies as a new `hrd` module:
  - `hrd::HrdParameters` decoded with full common-info gating
    (`nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag`,
    `vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag`,
    `sub_pic_hrd_params_present_flag`, the conditional `u(8)` /
    `u(5)` / `u(4)` / `u(5)` length / scale block from §E.2.2),
    `commonInfPresentFlag = 0` inheritance from a previous entry's
    `HrdCommonInfo`, and the per-sub-layer loop
    (`fixed_pic_rate_general_flag[i]`,
    `fixed_pic_rate_within_cvs_flag[i]` with the §E.3.2 "general == 1
    ⇒ within_cvs := 1" inference, `elemental_duration_in_tc_minus1[i]`
    `ue(v)` range-checked at 0..=2047,
    `low_delay_hrd_flag[i]`, and `cpb_cnt_minus1[i]` `ue(v)`
    range-checked at 0..=31 with the §E.3.2 "inferred to 0" path when
    `low_delay_hrd_flag[i] == 1`).
  - `hrd::SubLayerHrdParameters` decoded per §E.2.3 with the
    monotonic-progression constraints from §E.3.3 enforced inline
    (`bit_rate_value_minus1[i]` strictly increasing,
    `cpb_size_value_minus1[i]` monotonic non-increasing, and the
    sub-pic `bit_rate_du_value_minus1[i]` /
    `cpb_size_du_value_minus1[i]` variants gated on
    `sub_pic_hrd_params_present_flag`).
  - `hrd::VpsHrdEntry` wraps each entry of the §7.3.2.1 VPS HRD loop
    (`hrd_layer_set_idx[i]` `ue(v)` with the
    `vps_num_layer_sets_minus1 + 1` ceiling, the per-index
    `cprms_present_flag[i]` `u(1)` for `i > 0` with the implicit `1`
    inference for `i == 0`, and the body itself).
- VPS RBSP parse now decodes the per-HRD bodies inline rather than
  capturing them as the opaque tail:
  - `HevcVps::hrd_parameters: Vec<VpsHrdEntry>` populated when
    `vps_timing_info_present_flag == 1` and `vps_num_hrd_parameters >
    0`, with `cprms_present_flag[i] == 0` inheritance walked through
    the previously-parsed entry's `HrdCommonInfo`.
  - `HevcVps::vps_extension_flag` is now an unconditional `bool` (was
    `Option<bool>`); the parser always reads it after the HRD loop
    completes.
  - `HevcVps::opaque_tail` now populated only for the
    `vps_extension_flag == 1` extension-data + `rbsp_trailing_bits()`
    suffix (the per-HRD-body deferral is gone).
  - `VpsError::Hrd` variant added to surface `HrdError` failures
    inside the VPS HRD loop while preserving the single-pattern
    `Truncated` handler.
- Public re-exports: `CpbEntry`, `HrdCommonInfo`, `HrdError`,
  `HrdParameters`, `SubLayerHrd`, `SubLayerHrdParameters`,
  `VpsHrdEntry`, `HEVC_MAX_CPB_CNT`,
  `HEVC_MAX_ELEMENTAL_DURATION_IN_TC_MINUS1` added to the crate root;
  `Error::Hrd` variant added.
- Tests: 12 new tests
  (`hrd::parses_minimal_common_info_one_sub_layer`,
  `hrd::parses_nal_hrd_with_sub_pic_and_two_cpbs`,
  `hrd::rejects_non_increasing_bit_rate_value`,
  `hrd::rejects_elemental_duration_above_2047`,
  `hrd::rejects_cpb_cnt_above_31`,
  `hrd::low_delay_infers_cpb_cnt_zero`,
  `hrd::cprms_zero_inherits_previous_common_info`,
  `hrd::vps_hrd_entry_skips_cprms_for_index_zero`,
  `hrd::vps_hrd_entry_reads_cprms_for_nonzero_index`,
  `hrd::cprms_zero_without_previous_yields_no_hrd_bodies`,
  `hrd::parses_three_sub_layers`,
  `vps::parses_two_hrd_entries_with_cprms_inheritance`); the round-12
  `captures_hrd_payload_as_opaque_tail` was repurposed into
  `parses_hrd_payload_inline` and now asserts the per-HRD body is
  decoded rather than captured. Test count 118 → 130.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 12 (2026-05-25)

- §7.3.2.1 VPS tail through the optional VPS timing-info block:
  - `vps_max_layer_id` (`u(6)`) and `vps_num_layer_sets_minus1`
    (`ue(v)`, range 0..=1023, capped at
    `HEVC_VPS_MAX_NUM_LAYER_SETS = 1024` for allocation safety) added
    to `HevcVps`.
  - `layer_id_included_flag[i][j]` inclusion matrix decoded as one
    `LayerIdInclusionRow` per signalled layer set (the spec's
    `i = 1..=vps_num_layer_sets_minus1` loop; layer set 0 is implicit
    per §7.4.3.1, so the matrix has `num_layer_sets_minus1` rows of
    `max_layer_id + 1` flags each).
  - `vps_timing_info_present_flag` block surfaced as
    `Option<VpsTimingInfo>`: `vps_num_units_in_tick` /
    `vps_time_scale` (`u(32)` both, with the §E.2.1 / §7.3.2.1 "shall
    be greater than 0" semantics enforced as
    `VpsError::ValueOutOfRange`), `vps_poc_proportional_to_timing_flag`
    + the optional `vps_num_ticks_poc_diff_one_minus1` `ue(v)`, and
    the `vps_num_hrd_parameters` `ue(v)` count (bounded at
    `vps_num_layer_sets_minus1 + 1` per §7.4.3.1).
  - `vps_extension_flag` decoded into `Option<bool>` (None when the
    parser stopped before reading it because
    `vps_num_hrd_parameters > 0` deferred the rest of the RBSP to the
    opaque tail).
  - `HevcVps::opaque_tail: Option<OpaqueTail>` populated when the
    parser defers HRD bodies (`num_hrd_parameters > 0`) or extension
    data (`vps_extension_flag == 1`); the opaque tail reuses
    `sps::OpaqueTail::capture_at(bit_pos, rbsp)` so the surface
    matches the SPS / PPS opaque-tail convention.
- Public re-exports: `LayerIdInclusionRow`, `VpsTimingInfo`,
  `HEVC_VPS_MAX_NUM_LAYERS`, `HEVC_VPS_MAX_NUM_LAYER_SETS` added to
  the crate root.
- Tests: three new VPS tail tests
  (`parses_layer_set_matrix_and_timing_info`,
  `captures_hrd_payload_as_opaque_tail`,
  `rejects_zero_num_units_in_tick`); two existing handwritten VPS
  tests extended to feed the now-required tail bits. Test count
  115 → 118.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 11 (2026-05-24)

- §9.3 CABAC arithmetic decoding engine as a new standalone module
  (`cabac`):
  - §9.3.2.6 engine-register initialization: `CabacEngine::new`
    consumes a `BitReader` positioned at the first bit of
    `slice_segment_data()`, sets `ivlCurrRange = 510`, and reads the
    9-bit initial `ivlOffset` — enforcing the spec's "the bitstream
    shall not contain data that result in a value of ivlOffset being
    equal to 510 or 511" constraint as `CabacError::InvalidInitOffset`.
    `CabacEngine::init_engine` re-initializes the registers in place
    (the `pcm_flag == 1` re-init path).
  - §9.3.2.2 context-variable initialization: `ContextModel::init`
    evaluates equations 9-4..9-6 — `slopeIdx` / `offsetIdx`,
    `m = slopeIdx * 5 − 45`, `n = ( offsetIdx << 3 ) − 16`, then
    `preCtxState = Clip3( 1, 126, ( ( m * Clip3( 0, 51, SliceQpY ) ) >> 4 ) + n )`,
    with `valMps` / `pStateIdx` split. The §9.3.2.2 `initType`
    selector (equation 9-7) is exposed as the free function
    `init_type(slice_type, cabac_init_flag)`. `ContextModel::terminate_state`
    yields the §9.3.2.2 NOTE 2 non-adapting `(pStateIdx = 63,
    valMps = 0)` state.
  - §9.3.4.3.2 `DecodeDecision`: `CabacEngine::decode_decision`
    derives `qRangeIdx = ( ivlCurrRange >> 6 ) & 3`, looks up
    `ivlLpsRange` in the Table 9-52 `rangeTabLps[64][4]`, performs
    the LPS / MPS branch on `ivlOffset`, applies the §9.3.4.3.2.2
    state transition (Table 9-53 `transIdxLps` / `transIdxMps`, with
    the `pStateIdx == 0` LPS path flipping `valMps`), and invokes
    `RenormD`. Mutates the supplied `ContextModel` in place.
  - §9.3.4.3.3 `RenormD` renormalization loop, internal to the
    engine: while `ivlCurrRange < 256`, double the range and shift
    one fresh `read_bits(1)` into `ivlOffset`.
  - §9.3.4.3.4 `DecodeBypass`: `CabacEngine::decode_bypass` shifts a
    fresh bit into `ivlOffset` and compares it to `ivlCurrRange`,
    returning the equal-probability bin. `decode_bypass_bits(n)` is a
    convenience wrapper that accumulates `n` bypass bins MSB-first
    into a `u32` (the common fixed-length bypass pattern).
  - §9.3.4.3.5 `DecodeTerminate`: `CabacEngine::decode_terminate`
    decrements `ivlCurrRange` by 2, returns 1 if `ivlOffset >=
    ivlCurrRange` (no renormalization — decoding is terminated) and
    otherwise returns 0 with renormalization. This is the
    `end_of_slice_segment_flag` / `end_of_subset_one_bit` /
    `pcm_flag` decision (ctxTable = 0, ctxIdx = 0).
  - §9.3.4.3.6 alignment process prior to aligned bypass decoding:
    `CabacEngine::align` sets `ivlCurrRange = 256` (the
    pre-`coeff_abs_level_remaining[ ]` / `coeff_sign_flag[ ]` hook);
    `ivlOffset` and the bit reader are untouched.
- 20 new `cabac` unit tests: equation 9-7 truth table; equations
  9-4..9-6 worked examples at boundary `initValue` / `SliceQpY`
  combinations (negative-slope path, high `initValue`, sub-zero QP
  clipping); §9.3.2.2 NOTE 2 terminate-state values; Table 9-52
  corner / monotonicity checks; Table 9-53 transition bounds + LPS /
  MPS monotonicity; §9.3.2.6 engine-init bit consumption and the
  forbidden 510 / 511 rejection; bypass MSB-first bit accumulation
  and the `offset >= range` path; terminate one / zero / no-renorm
  paths; alignment register set; `DecodeDecision` MPS-no-renorm and
  LPS-with-renorm paths (including the `pStateIdx == 0` MPS flip);
  an all-zero-stream MPS-state-walk integration check; and an
  end-of-buffer surfacing test.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 10 (2026-05-24)

- The remaining three §6.5 scan-order initialization processes, joining
  round 9's §6.5.3 up-right diagonal scan in the `scan` module:
  - §6.5.4 horizontal scan ([`horizontal`], equation 6-12) — a plain
    raster walk, `scanIdx == 1`.
  - §6.5.5 vertical scan ([`vertical`], equation 6-13) — the transpose
    of the horizontal scan (column by column), `scanIdx == 2`.
  - §6.5.6 traverse scan ([`traverse`], equation 6-14) — a
    boustrophedon (serpentine) raster, even rows left-to-right and odd
    rows right-to-left, `scanIdx == 3`.
- The §7.4.2 `ScanOrder[log2BlockSize][scanIdx]` accessor
  ([`scan_order`] / [`ScanIdx`] / [`ScanOrderError`]): dispatches to the
  §6.5.3..§6.5.6 process for the requested block size and scan index,
  enforcing the table's populated ranges — `log2BlockSize` 0..=3 for the
  diagonal / horizontal / vertical scans, 2..=5 for the traverse scan.
  This is the table the residual-coding path (§7.3.8.11 / §9.3.4.2.4)
  selects per transform block.
- 13 new byte-exact `scan` tests: hand-derived 4x4 / 2x2 expected
  coordinate vectors for each new scan, permutation / transpose /
  odd-row-reversal invariants across the populated block sizes, the
  `scan_order` dispatch-vs-builder equivalence, and the
  out-of-range rejection per §7.4.2.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 9 (2026-05-24)

- §6.5.3 up-right diagonal scan order (equation 6-11), in a new `scan`
  module ([`up_right_diagonal`] / [`ScanPos`]): a direct transcription
  of the 6-11 pseudocode, returning `diagScan[ sPos ]` for a
  `blkSize`x`blkSize` block. This is the `ScanOrder[log2BlockSize][0]`
  entry the §7.4.5 `ScalingFactor` derivation reads (4x4 and 8x8
  blocks). The §6.5.4..§6.5.6 horizontal / vertical / traverse scans
  are deferred to the residual-coding path.
- §7.4.5 `ScalingFactor[sizeId][matrixId][x][y]` 2-D
  quantization-matrix derivation (equations 7-44..7-51), via the new
  [`ScalingListData::scaling_factors`] /
  [`ScalingFactors`] / [`ScalingFactorMatrix`]:
  - 4x4 (equation 7-44) and 8x8 (7-45): each flat
    `ScalingList[sizeId][matrixId][i]` coefficient is placed at the
    `(ScanOrder[·][0][i][0], ScanOrder[·][0][i][1])` cell — `ScanOrder[2][0]`
    (4x4 block, 16 positions) for `sizeId == 0`, `ScanOrder[3][0]`
    (8x8 block, 64 positions) for `sizeId == 1`.
  - 16x16 (7-46): the 8x8-scan placement with each entry replicated
    into a 2x2 block (`x * 2 + k`, `y * 2 + j`), then the DC
    coefficient overrides `[0][0]` (7-47).
  - 32x32 (7-48): the 8x8-scan placement with each entry replicated
    into a 4x4 block (`x * 4 + k`, `y * 4 + j`) for `matrixId` 0 (intra
    Y) and 3 (inter Y) — the only slots the `matrixId += 3` step
    signals — then the DC override (7-49).
  - 32x32 chroma (7-50 / 7-51): when `ChromaArrayType == 3` (4:4:4),
    `matrixId` 1, 2, 4, 5 are derived from the 16x16 (`sizeId == 2`)
    lists of the same `matrixId`, 4x4-replicated, with the sizeId-2 DC
    override. For other chroma formats those matrices are left all-zero
    (they are not used).
  - `ScalingFactorMatrix` is stored row-major (`coef[y * dim + x]`)
    with a `dim` side length (4 / 8 / 16 / 32) and an `at(x, y)`
    accessor.
- 9 new unit tests (total 84, was 75): the §6.5.3 scan for 4x4 / 2x2
  blocks (hand-derived coordinate lists), the permutation invariant for
  the 4x4 / 8x8 blocks, and the 8x8 diagonal-ordering invariant; the
  4x4 all-16 `ScalingFactor`, the 8x8-intra diagonal-scan placement
  against Table 7-6, the 16x16 2x2 replication + isolated DC override,
  the 32x32 4x4 replication with the chroma matrices all-zero for
  non-4:4:4, and the 32x32-chroma derivation for `ChromaArrayType == 3`.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 8 (2026-05-24)

- §7.3.4 `scaling_list_data()` parse + §7.4.5
  `ScalingList[sizeId][matrixId][i]` derivation, in a new
  `scaling_list` module ([`ScalingListData`]):
  - For each of the 24 (`sizeId`, `matrixId`) slots,
    `scaling_list_pred_mode_flag` (`u(1)`) selects between a predicted
    list and an explicit list.
  - Predicted: `scaling_list_pred_matrix_id_delta` (`ue(v)`) with the
    §7.4.5 range check (`matrixId` for `sizeId <= 2`, `matrixId / 3`
    for `sizeId == 3`). Delta 0 infers the §7.4.5 default list;
    otherwise `refMatrixId = matrixId − delta * (sizeId == 3 ? 3 : 1)`
    (equation 7-42) and the reference list (with its DC coefficient) is
    copied (equation 7-43).
  - Explicit: the running `nextCoef` accumulator, seeded at 8 and
    updated as `(nextCoef + scaling_list_delta_coef + 256) % 256`
    (§7.3.4), with `scaling_list_dc_coef_minus8` (`se(v)`) read first
    for `sizeId > 1` (range −7..=247) supplying the DC coefficient.
  - The default 4x4 / 8x8 intra/inter tables (Tables 7-5 / 7-6) are
    transcribed; `coefNum = Min(64, 1 << (4 + (sizeId << 1)))`.
  - Conformance checks: `scaling_list_pred_matrix_id_delta` bound,
    `scaling_list_dc_coef_minus8 ∈ [−7, 247]`, and derived coefficient
    `> 0`, each surfaced through [`ScalingListError`].
- The block is wired into both the SPS
  (`sps_scaling_list_data_present_flag`, nested under
  `scaling_list_enabled_flag`) and the PPS
  (`pps_scaling_list_data_present_flag`) parse paths, replacing the
  previous outright refusals (`SpsError::ScalingListUnsupported` /
  `PpsError::ScalingListUnsupported` removed in favour of
  `SpsError::ScalingList` / `PpsError::ScalingList`). When
  `scaling_list_enabled_flag == 1` but
  `sps_scaling_list_data_present_flag == 0`, the SPS now parses (the
  §7.4.5 default lists apply) — previously it was rejected.
- `SeqParameterSet` gains `sps_scaling_list_data_present_flag` and
  `scaling_list_data`; `PicParameterSet` gains `scaling_list_data`.
- 10 new unit tests (total 75, was 65): all-default lists matching
  Tables 7-5 / 7-6; `coefNum` per `sizeId`; explicit flat 4x4 list;
  explicit 16x16 list with a DC coefficient; prediction copying a
  reference list; and rejections for out-of-range
  `scaling_list_pred_matrix_id_delta`, non-positive coefficient,
  out-of-range DC coefficient, and truncation — plus the SPS
  default-list / explicit-list and PPS explicit-list integration
  tests. The previous `rejects_scaling_list_enabled` SPS test and
  `rejects_scaling_list_present` PPS test were rewritten in place (not
  ignored) to assert the new parse-through behaviour.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 7 (2026-05-24)

- §7.3.6.1 non-IDR POC + reference-picture-set block — the
  `slice_segment_header()` sub-block gated by
  `nal_unit_type != IDR_W_RADL && nal_unit_type != IDR_N_LP`, closing
  the opaque tail previously surfaced for non-IDR I-slice segments:
  - `slice_pic_order_cnt_lsb` (`u(v)`, width
    `log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4 + 4`, range
    0..=`MaxPicOrderCntLsb − 1`).
  - `short_term_ref_pic_set_sps_flag` (`u(1)`), with the §7.4.7.1
    constraint that the value shall be 0 when
    `num_short_term_ref_pic_sets == 0`.
  - In-line `st_ref_pic_set(num_short_term_ref_pic_sets)` (§7.3.7)
    when `short_term_ref_pic_set_sps_flag == 0`, exposed via a new
    `ShortTermRefPicSet::parse_slice_inline(&mut BitReader, &SeqParameterSet)`
    public entry point that wraps the existing per-set parser with the
    SPS context (`stRpsIdx == num_short_term_ref_pic_sets`, `all_rps =
    sps.short_term_ref_pic_sets`).
  - `short_term_ref_pic_set_idx` (`u(v)`, width
    `Ceil(Log2(num_short_term_ref_pic_sets))`) when
    `short_term_ref_pic_set_sps_flag == 1 && num_short_term_ref_pic_sets > 1`
    (inferred to 0 otherwise).
  - The long-term-ref-pic block gated by
    `sps.long_term_ref_pics_present_flag`: `num_long_term_sps`
    (`ue(v)`, bounded by `num_long_term_ref_pics_sps`),
    `num_long_term_pics` (`ue(v)`), and the per-entry
    `lt_idx_sps[i]` (`u(v)`, width
    `Ceil(Log2(num_long_term_ref_pics_sps))`) /
    `poc_lsb_lt[i]` + `used_by_curr_pic_lt_flag[i]` /
    `delta_poc_msb_present_flag[i]` /
    `delta_poc_msb_cycle_lt[i]` (`ue(v)`) loop. The §7.4.7.1
    inferences (`num_long_term_sps == 0`, `delta_poc_msb_cycle_lt ==
    0`) are applied for absent fields, and a defensive 16-entry
    ceiling on `num_long_term_pics` (matching the
    §7.4.3.2.1 DPB-size bound) prevents a pathological encoder from
    forcing an unbounded allocation.
- `SliceLongTermRefPic` + `SliceLongTermRefPicSource` (public) carry
  the per-entry source (SPS-indexed vs in-slice signalling) and the
  delta-POC-MSB cycle.
- `SliceSegmentHeader` gains `slice_pic_order_cnt_lsb`,
  `short_term_ref_pic_set_sps_flag`, `inline_short_term_ref_pic_set`,
  `short_term_ref_pic_set_idx`, `num_long_term_sps`,
  `num_long_term_pics`, and `long_term_ref_pics` fields. The opaque
  tail is now populated *only* for the P/B reference-list /
  weighted-prediction body (round 8 target); independent I-slice
  segments — IDR and non-IDR alike — parse all the way through
  `byte_alignment()`.
- `SliceError::InlineShortTermRpsParse(SpsError)` wraps SPS-layer
  failures from the in-line `st_ref_pic_set` parse, with truncation
  and bit-stream errors flattened back into `SliceError::Truncated` /
  `SliceError::Bitstream` so the public surface stays predictable.
- 4 new unit tests (total 65, was 61): hand-assembled non-IDR I-slice
  CRA header with the in-line zero-pic short-term RPS;
  SPS-resident short-term RPS with a single SPS entry (index inferred);
  SPS-resident with multiple entries (`short_term_ref_pic_set_idx`
  `u(v)` width = `Ceil(Log2(N))`); long-term-ref-pic block with one
  SPS-indexed + one in-slice entry plus a `delta_poc_msb_cycle_lt`;
  rejection of `short_term_ref_pic_set_sps_flag == 1` when
  `num_short_term_ref_pic_sets == 0`. The previously-deferred
  `defers_non_idr_poc_block` test was rewritten in place rather than
  ignored — its old premise (non-IDR slice surfaces an opaque tail) is
  exactly what this round eliminates.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 6 (2026-05-24)

- §7.3.6.1 `SliceSegmentHeader` structural parse — the
  `slice_segment_header()` syntax structure for an independent slice
  segment, taking the activated SPS + PPS as parse context (several
  field widths and presence gates are SPS/PPS-derived):
  - `first_slice_segment_in_pic_flag`, `no_output_of_prior_pics_flag`
    (only present in the IRAP NAL-unit-type range
    `BLA_W_LP..=RSV_IRAP_VCL23`), `slice_pic_parameter_set_id` (ue(v),
    0..=63).
  - For non-first segments: `dependent_slice_segment_flag` (only when
    `dependent_slice_segments_enabled_flag`) and `slice_segment_address`
    (u(v), width `Ceil( Log2( PicSizeInCtbsY ) )`, range-checked
    against `PicSizeInCtbsY`).
  - For independent segments: the `slice_reserved_flag[]` block
    (`num_extra_slice_header_bits` flags), `slice_type` (Table 7-7,
    rejected outside 0..=2), `pic_output_flag` (only when
    `output_flag_present_flag`; inferred 1 otherwise), `colour_plane_id`
    (only when `separate_colour_plane_flag`),
    `slice_temporal_mvp_enabled_flag` (only when
    `sps_temporal_mvp_enabled_flag`).
  - SAO block: `slice_sao_luma_flag` + `slice_sao_chroma_flag`
    (the latter gated on `ChromaArrayType != 0`).
  - I-slice tail through `byte_alignment()`: `slice_qp_delta` (se(v)),
    `slice_c{b,r}_qp_offset` (se(v), −12..=12, gated by
    `pps_slice_chroma_qp_offsets_present_flag`), the deblocking-filter
    override block (`SliceDeblocking` — `deblocking_filter_override_flag`
    / `slice_deblocking_filter_disabled_flag` /
    `slice_beta_offset_div2` / `slice_tc_offset_div2`, se(v), −6..=6,
    with the §7.4.7.1 PPS-inference defaults applied when absent),
    `slice_loop_filter_across_slices_enabled_flag` (with its
    SAO/deblock gate), the entry-point-offset block
    (`EntryPointOffsets` — `num_entry_point_offsets` /
    `offset_len_minus1` 0..=31 / skipped `entry_point_offset_minus1[]`)
    when `tiles_enabled_flag || entropy_coding_sync_enabled_flag`, and
    the slice-segment-header extension block. `byte_alignment()` is
    consumed and `byte_offset_to_slice_data` reports where
    `slice_segment_data()` begins.
  - Convenience `slice_qp_y(pps)` = `26 + init_qp_minus26 +
    slice_qp_delta` (equation 7-54).
- Two deferred bodies are surfaced as an `sps::OpaqueTail` rather than
  decoded, because they need state this round does not carry:
  - The non-IDR picture-order-count + reference-picture-set block
    (needs the SPS short-term-RPS parser re-entered for the in-line
    `stRpsIdx == num_short_term_ref_pic_sets` case) — the parser stops
    after `colour_plane_id` when `nal_unit_type` is not
    `IDR_W_RADL` / `IDR_N_LP`.
  - The P/B reference-list-modification (§7.3.6.2) / weighted-prediction
    (§7.3.6.3) sub-structures (need DPB-derived `NumPicTotalCurr` /
    `RefPicList`) — the parser stops after the SAO block when
    `slice_type` is P or B.
- Top-level `Error::Slice(SliceError)` variant + `From<SliceError>`.
  Public `SliceType`, `SliceDeblocking`, `EntryPointOffsets`, and the
  `BLA_W_LP` / `IDR_W_RADL` / `IDR_N_LP` / `RSV_IRAP_VCL23` Table-7-1
  constants.
- 9 new unit tests (total 61, was 52): Table-7-7 `slice_type` mapping +
  `is_inter`; `Ceil( Log2( N ) )` width table; a hand-assembled
  independent I-slice IDR header parsed end-to-end through
  `byte_alignment()` (SliceQpY=25); the non-IDR POC-block deferral
  (opaque tail); the P/B ref-list deferral (opaque tail); a non-first
  dependent slice segment (`slice_segment_address` u(2)); end-to-end
  parse via the Annex B walker; truncated-RBSP rejection;
  `slice_type > 2` rejection.

### Note — tiny-fixture slice trace inconsistency (docs gap)

- `docs/video/h265/fixtures/tiny-i-only-16x16-main/trace.txt`'s
  `SLICE_HEADER` line reports `temporal_mvp=0 sao_c=1 slice_qp_delta=-1`,
  but its own `SPS` line (and this crate's verified SPS parse) has
  `sps_temporal_mvp_enabled_flag=1`, so per §7.3.6.1
  `slice_temporal_mvp_enabled_flag` **is** present. Parsing the real
  slice NAL bytes with mvp present yields `sao_c=0 slice_qp_delta=0` and
  an invalid `byte_alignment()` pad (`1 0 0 0`); parsing with mvp absent
  yields the trace's `sao_c=1 slice_qp_delta=-1` and a clean byte-aligned
  pad. The slice bits are therefore self-consistent only with
  `sps_temporal_mvp_enabled_flag=0`, contradicting the SPS line. Because
  the fixture's SPS and slice are mutually inconsistent, the round-6
  slice tests use hand-assembled bit vectors instead of asserting the
  fixture slice's exact fields. Recommend the docs collaborator
  regenerate the tiny fixture's trace (or confirm the SPS↔slice
  mismatch is a validator/instrumentation artefact in the source fixture).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 5 (2026-05-24)

- §7.3.2.3.1 `PicParameterSet` structural parse — the full general
  `pic_parameter_set_rbsp()` body through `pps_extension_present_flag`:
  - `pps_pic_parameter_set_id` (ue(v), 0..=63) +
    `pps_seq_parameter_set_id` (ue(v), 0..=15).
  - The slice-header gates `dependent_slice_segments_enabled_flag`,
    `output_flag_present_flag`, `num_extra_slice_header_bits` (u3, not
    range-checked per §7.4.3.3.1 "decoders shall allow any value"),
    `sign_data_hiding_enabled_flag`, `cabac_init_present_flag`.
  - `num_ref_idx_l0_default_active_minus1` /
    `num_ref_idx_l1_default_active_minus1` (ue(v), 0..=14).
  - `init_qp_minus26` (se(v)) range-checked against the loosest legal
    bound −74..=25; `init_qp_in_range(bit_depth_luma_minus8)` re-checks
    against the exact §7.4.3.3.1 lower bound −( 26 + QpBdOffsetY ) once
    the active SPS bit depth is known.
  - `constrained_intra_pred_flag`, `transform_skip_enabled_flag`,
    `cu_qp_delta_enabled_flag` + `diff_cu_qp_delta_depth` (inferred 0
    when disabled), `pps_cb_qp_offset` / `pps_cr_qp_offset` (se(v),
    −12..=12), `pps_slice_chroma_qp_offsets_present_flag`,
    `weighted_pred_flag`, `weighted_bipred_flag`,
    `transquant_bypass_enabled_flag`.
  - `tiles_enabled_flag` + `entropy_coding_sync_enabled_flag`, and the
    tiles block (`TileInfo`): `num_tile_columns_minus1` /
    `num_tile_rows_minus1`, `uniform_spacing_flag`, and the
    `column_width_minus1[]` / `row_height_minus1[]` arrays when
    `uniform_spacing_flag == 0`, plus
    `loop_filter_across_tiles_enabled_flag`. When `tiles_enabled_flag`
    is 0 the §7.4.3.3.1 single-tile inference (one column, one row,
    uniform spacing, loop filter across tiles enabled) is materialised.
  - `pps_loop_filter_across_slices_enabled_flag` and the
    deblocking-filter-control block (`DeblockingFilterControl`):
    `deblocking_filter_override_enabled_flag`,
    `pps_deblocking_filter_disabled_flag`, and `pps_beta_offset_div2` /
    `pps_tc_offset_div2` (se(v), −6..=6) when the filter is not
    disabled; absent-control inference applied per §7.4.3.3.1.
  - `pps_scaling_list_data_present_flag` — **rejected** with
    `PpsError::ScalingListUnsupported` when 1 (shared deferral with the
    SPS scaling-list path).
  - `lists_modification_present_flag`,
    `log2_parallel_merge_level_minus2`,
    `slice_segment_header_extension_present_flag`,
    `pps_extension_present_flag` — when set, the four extension flags,
    their bodies, and `rbsp_trailing_bits()` are surfaced as a shared
    `sps::OpaqueTail` via the new public `OpaqueTail::capture_at`.
- `BitReader::se()` — 0-th-order signed Exp-Golomb (the se(v)
  descriptor) per §9.2.2 Table 9-3: codeNum k → (−1)^(k+1)·Ceil(k/2).
- Convenience derivations on `PicParameterSet`: `init_qp()`,
  `num_ref_idx_l{0,1}_default_active()`, `num_tile_{columns,rows}()`,
  `log2_par_mrg_level()`.
- Top-level `Error::Pps(PpsError)` variant + `From<PpsError>`.
- 10 new unit tests (total 52, was 42): se(v) Table-9-3 mapping +
  single-bit-zero on `BitReader`; the fixture PPS parse cross-checked
  against `docs/video/h265/fixtures/tiny-i-only-16x16-main/trace.txt`
  (line 3); end-to-end PPS parse via the Annex B walker; a
  hand-assembled tiles + deblocking-control PPS (non-uniform spacing,
  non-zero β / tC offsets); opaque PPS-extension tail capture;
  `pps_scaling_list_data_present_flag == 1` rejection;
  `pps_pic_parameter_set_id > 63` rejection; truncated-RBSP rejection;
  SPS-bit-depth-aware `init_qp_in_range` check.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 4 (2026-05-22)

- §7.3.2.2 SPS tail past `sample_adaptive_offset_enabled_flag`:
  - `pcm_enabled_flag` + the `pcm_*` block (`PcmInfo`):
    `pcm_sample_bit_depth_luma_minus1` / `_chroma_minus1` (4-bit
    each, validated against the `BitDepthY` / `BitDepthC` derived
    from the earlier `bit_depth_*_minus8` fields per equations
    7-25 / 7-26), `log2_min_pcm_luma_coding_block_size_minus3`,
    `log2_diff_max_min_pcm_luma_coding_block_size`,
    `pcm_loop_filter_disabled_flag`.
  - `num_short_term_ref_pic_sets` (ue(v), 0..=64 per §7.4.3.2) +
    `Vec<ShortTermRefPicSet>` populated by the §7.3.7 parser. Both
    forms are materialised: the explicit
    `num_negative_pics` / `num_positive_pics` /
    `delta_poc_s{0,1}_minus1[i]` / `used_by_curr_pic_s{0,1}_flag[i]`
    form, and the inter-RPS-prediction form
    (`inter_ref_pic_set_prediction_flag`, `delta_idx_minus1`,
    `delta_rps_sign`, `abs_delta_rps_minus1`, plus the
    `used_by_curr_pic_flag[j]` / `use_delta_flag[j]` arrays of
    length `NumDeltaPocs[RefRpsIdx] + 1`). `RefRpsIdx` chains
    through the preceding RPS list per §7.4.8;
    `delta_idx_minus1` is only signalled when
    `stRpsIdx == num_short_term_ref_pic_sets` (the slice-header
    in-line form is handled by inferring 0 for SPS entries).
    `use_delta_flag[j]` is inferred to 1 when
    `used_by_curr_pic_flag[j] == 1` per §7.4.8.
  - `long_term_ref_pics_present_flag` block:
    `num_long_term_ref_pics_sps` (0..=32) +
    `Vec<LongTermRefPicEntry>` carrying `lt_ref_pic_poc_lsb_sps[i]`
    (parsed as `u(log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4 + 4)`) +
    `used_by_curr_pic_lt_sps_flag[i]`.
  - `sps_temporal_mvp_enabled_flag` (u1).
  - `strong_intra_smoothing_enabled_flag` (u1).
  - `vui_parameters_present_flag` (u1) — when set, the VUI body
    plus the trailing `sps_extension_present_flag` and any
    extension payload + `rbsp_trailing_bits()` are surfaced as
    a single `OpaqueTail { bytes, start_bit_in_first_byte }`.
  - `sps_extension_present_flag` (u1) — known precisely when the
    VUI gate is 0. When set, the extension flag block plus any
    extension body and the RBSP trailer are surfaced as
    `OpaqueTail`.
- Convenience derivation `max_pic_order_cnt_lsb()` returning
  `1 << (log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4 + 4)` per §7.4.3.2.1.
- 8 new unit tests: `pcm_enabled` happy path; PCM-depth-exceeds-luma
  rejection; one explicit short-term RPS; inter-RPS-prediction
  short-term RPS chaining; long-term-ref-pic block; opaque VUI tail
  capture; opaque extension tail capture; clean tail (both flags
  off, no opaque). Total test count: 42 (was 34).
- Fixture `parses_tiny_fixture_sps` extended to assert every newly-parsed
  tail field against
  `docs/video/h265/fixtures/tiny-i-only-16x16-main/trace.txt`
  (pcm_enabled=0, num_short_term_ref_pic_sets=0,
  long_term_ref_pics=0, temporal_mvp=1, strong_intra_smoothing=1,
  vui present).

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 3 (2026-05-22)

- §7.3.2.2 `SeqParameterSet` structural parse — `sps_video_parameter_set_id`
  (u4), `sps_max_sub_layers_minus1` (u3, 0..=6 range-checked),
  `sps_temporal_id_nesting_flag`, the §7.3.3 `profile_tier_level()`
  re-walk, `sps_seq_parameter_set_id` (ue(v), 0..=15),
  `chroma_format_idc` (ue(v), 0..=3), `separate_colour_plane_flag`
  (parsed only when `chroma_format_idc == 3`),
  `pic_width_in_luma_samples` / `pic_height_in_luma_samples` (ue(v),
  non-zero per §7.4.3.2), `conformance_window_flag` + the four
  `conf_win_{left,right,top,bottom}_offset` ue(v) values,
  `bit_depth_{luma,chroma}_minus8` (ue(v), 0..=8 range-checked),
  `log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4` (ue(v), 0..=12), the
  per-sub-layer DPB / reorder / latency triple loop with
  ordering-info-present-flag propagation (§7.4.3.2.1),
  `log2_min_luma_coding_block_size_minus3`,
  `log2_diff_max_min_luma_coding_block_size`,
  `log2_min_luma_transform_block_size_minus2`,
  `log2_diff_max_min_luma_transform_block_size`,
  `max_transform_hierarchy_depth_{inter,intra}`,
  `scaling_list_enabled_flag` (rejected when set; `scaling_list_data()`
  deferred), `amp_enabled_flag`, `sample_adaptive_offset_enabled_flag`.
- Convenience derivations: `bit_depth_luma()`, `bit_depth_chroma()`,
  `log2_min_cb_size()`, `log2_ctb_size()`, `log2_min_tb_size()` —
  the field combinations §7.4.3.2.1 calls `BitDepthY`, `BitDepthC`,
  `MinCbLog2SizeY`, `CtbLog2SizeY`, `MinTbLog2SizeY`.
- 8 new unit tests: fixture parse against the SPS RBSP from
  `docs/video/h265/fixtures/tiny-i-only-16x16-main/input.hevc`
  (cross-checked against `trace.txt`); end-to-end VPS+SPS parse via
  the Annex B walker; emulation-prevention-strip equivalence;
  truncated-RBSP rejection; hand-assembled `chroma_format_idc == 3`
  + conformance-window 10-bit 4:4:4 path; hand-assembled
  `sub_layer_ordering_info_present_flag == 0` propagation across
  two sub-layers; `scaling_list_enabled_flag == 1` rejection;
  `chroma_format_idc == 4` out-of-range rejection.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 2 (2026-05-22)

- MSB-first `BitReader` with `u(n)` and 0-th-order
  unsigned-Exp-Golomb `ue(v)` (§9.2) descriptors; `skip(n)` to
  bit-walk over not-yet-materialised fields without parsing them.
- §7.3.2.1 `HevcVps` structural parse — `vps_video_parameter_set_id`
  (u4), `vps_base_layer_internal_flag` / `vps_base_layer_available_flag`,
  `vps_max_layers_minus1` (u6), `vps_max_sub_layers_minus1` (u3 with
  the §7.4.3.1 0..=6 range check), `vps_temporal_id_nesting_flag`,
  `vps_reserved_0xffff_16bits` validation (rejects any value other
  than `0xFFFF`), the §7.3.3 `profile_tier_level()` walk, and the
  per-sub-layer DPB / reorder / latency `ue(v)` triple loop with
  ordering-info-present-flag propagation.
- §7.3.3 `ProfileTierLevel` — materialises
  `general_profile_space` / `_tier_flag` / `_profile_idc` /
  `_level_idc` and the per-sub-layer
  `sub_layer_profile_present_flag` / `_level_present_flag` gates
  plus `sub_layer_level_idc[i]`. The constraint-flag / reserved-zero
  blocks are walked structurally (their bit width is fixed at 43
  bits regardless of the inner conditional branch per the
  `/* not affected by this condition */` note in the syntax table)
  so subsequent VPS fields land on the right bit boundary.
- 17 new unit tests: bit-reader `u(n)` MSB-first packing /
  cross-byte read / `u(0)` zero-consume / `u(32)` full word /
  end-of-buffer / too-many-bits / skip / `ue(v)` codewords 0..=6
  per Table 9-2 / single-bit zero / leading-zero-overrun;
  VPS fixture parse (against
  `docs/video/h265/fixtures/tiny-i-only-16x16-main/input.hevc` — the
  on-wire bytes are inlined into the test, no I/O); end-to-end VPS
  parse via the Annex B walker; reserved-field mismatch rejection;
  truncated-RBSP rejection; emulation-prevention round-trip equality;
  hand-assembled two-sub-layer ordering-info-present-flag=1 parse;
  hand-assembled ordering-info-present-flag=0 propagation parse.

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 1 (2026-05-20)

- Annex B byte-stream walker: `NalIter`, `collect_nal_units`,
  supporting both 3-byte (`00 00 01`) and 4-byte (`00 00 00 01`)
  start codes.
- §7.3.1.2 NAL header parse: `NalHeader` exposes
  `nal_unit_type`, `nuh_layer_id`, and `TemporalId` (derived from
  `nuh_temporal_id_plus1`); `forbidden_zero_bit` set and
  zero-`nuh_temporal_id_plus1` are surfaced as `NalError`.
- §7.4.1.1 emulation-prevention strip
  (`strip_emulation_prevention`) — `0x00 0x00 0x03` decodes to
  `0x00 0x00`.
- 7 unit tests covering: 3-byte start code single NAL, 4-byte
  start code with two NAL units, emulation-prevention round-trip,
  forbidden-bit rejection, zero-temporal-id rejection, no
  start-code-at-all rejection, and header field-packing round
  trip (incl. non-zero `nuh_layer_id`).

### Erased

- Prior master history was force-erased on **2026-05-18** under
  Hat-3 cold enforcement of the workspace clean-room policy
  (`docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md`).

### Reset

- Crate reduced to a minimal `oxideav_core::register!` stub. Every
  public API returns `Error::NotImplemented`. The crates.io version
  (`0.0.8`) is preserved on the new master to avoid breaking
  downstream version pins; the published versions on crates.io will
  be yanked by the maintainer.
- HEIF/HEIC `heif` cargo feature is dropped from the scaffold
  (re-introduced in a future rebuild round once the decoder core is
  back).

### Next

- Slice segment header parse (§7.3.6.1).
- PPS range / SCC extensions (§7.3.2.3.2 / §7.3.2.3.3) — currently
  surfaced as opaque bytes when `pps_extension_present_flag == 1`.
- VUI parameters (§E.2.1) — currently surfaced as opaque bytes.
- SPS extension bodies (Range Extension, Multilayer, 3D, SCC) —
  currently surfaced as opaque bytes alongside the VUI tail.
